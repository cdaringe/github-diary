I could look into that but am unsure on the ramifications to motor health.  I am using pololu's.  I really don't think this is the solution based on the fact that most prints are healthy\n3. No endstop errors.\n4. Yes, decent stationary torque and recommend motors on the wiki\n\nSkipped steps are not the status quo.  Rather, they tend to show up on thin features when the x or y axis oscillates back and forth & high speeds/frequencies.  I believe this is when i occasionally drop a step.  I wrote a brute force algorithm in the sprinter experimental github to force the head to stay stationary for x milliseconds on a direction change to alleviate such 'jerk.'  I was excited to see that someone was trying to put nophead's frequency reduction algorithm in Marlin--that's exactly what i wanted!\n\nHowever, i may bring my accel back up & keep my jerk low.\n",

I've actually gone as far as repositioning my head as you've described, setting absolute coords via GCODE, then deleting my .gcode file's line 1 thru line ##,### and simply hitting 'print' after setting the temp.  It worked pretty dang well!  It was a mendelMax plate for a friend.  However, it was clearly imperfect and had showed an obvious jog.\n\nThe ability to repeatably reposition a head after a failure I believe is _so_ difficult that it may not warrant SW dev activity.\n",

Is there anything we could do feasibly by making the DOM element `observable` somehow?  To summarize\n- No proper change events from external components + with sloppy `.input` change detection === biased/lagging state.  This is an edge-case, but likely a **common one** outside of my own dev work\n- Not all forms need the input value for state (mine included), but said form does need an honest value at submission.  `myValue.input` return value as it stands === misleading `myInput.value` return/behavior\n",

Any subsequent bindings must attach to the rendered ampersand FieldView input.\n2) Let me use my own input el, and still attache the templated validation message nodes\n3) Let me use my own input el, but force me to provide additional validation message nodes\n\nI pursued option 2.  After our last conversation and another I've been having with wraithgar, maybe we want to scrap this, but provide another `attr` that can _easily identify the input_ such that my managing form can conveniently query into the FieldView and do additional bindings/activity to the input.\n",

      "body": "the problem with the SelectView is as follows. when the SelectView is initialized, this.value is set to null. If you provide a nully `value: xzy` to the constructor, then `.validate()` will never get called. The result is that when the form `checkValid()`, `.valid` is undefined on the SelectView, thus the form is invalid. Providing a null value is a realistic case. For example, I am querying for a value, and sometimes, that value doesn't exist. validate() won't be called because of this line in setValue(), triggered by the constructor, https://github.com/cdaringe/ampersand-select-view/blob/master/ampersand-select-view.js#L181 . I think the solution is perhaps to either:\n1. set this.value to undefined, which could potentially still result in the same failiure mode\n2. set an init flag or force flag to force setValue() down through .validate() no matter what at least once. In this regard the .valid property will always be set to a bool initially, vs now, where it can be undefined\n3. eliminate the if (value === this.value) return; in setValue().  This is what i have done in my branch for the time being\n\nInputView works a completely different way and has a different structure, otherwise I'd say let's just copy that over.\n",

I understand that the intent of your question is how to get your API to return a result formatted a particular way, based on how you request it.  really, it's not related to `ampersand-select-view`, despite you asking if a server has similar functionality.  that's OK, but you'll probably want to dig through this issue in a forum more suited to API design.  however, keeping in helpful spirit, what the server does is entirely dependent on how the API you are using is designed _on the server_.  ampersand cannot control what the server gives back to the client--it can only SEND and RECEIVE, and hopefully whatever you have sent is reciprocated with something you want to receive!\n3. if the object you got back is raw, make sure that you've defined a corresponding `state` or `model` definition for the `app.objects` collection.  I'd suppose this is a large source of your issue\n4. additionally, check out https://github.com/ampersandjs/ampersand-state#parse to see how to mutate results from the server.\n\nI think this issue can be closed :+1:   Good luck!\n",

As such, with my [3.0.0 proposal](https://github.com/AmpersandJS/ampersand-select-view/pull/34) (thanks for the review by the way), rather than _validate_ on construction, simply don't accept invalid options--period.  setting an invalid option is an application design error, so error out!\n\n@wraithgar, on \"what are we listening for\".  My thought process begins with \"what's the purpose of this field-view\"?  It's to produce a quality, validated value from the select control, per the designer's intent.  Therefore, I would suggest that we listen for any activity within our micro-DOM that impacts that `value`.  All other activity within the module orbits around it.  Thoughts?\n",

It mashes with a tiny bit with your great updates, so I'd plan on getting your stuff merged first, before requesting the community to look at mine.\n@erd0s, see [this line in your code](https://github.com/AmpersandJS/ampersand-select-view/pull/24/files#diff-cd18a4507088002c17b5ed65ce48e6c1R204) .  If the field doesn't validate immediately, `this.valid` doesn't get set, and the parent FormView won't know if the field is valid or not.  I believe your intent is not to show the messages, vs. determine the validity.  thus, see what I did [here in my PR](https://github.com/AmpersandJS/ampersand-select-view/pull/36/files#diff-cd18a4507088002c17b5ed65ce48e6c1R212).  `skipValidate` should really be `skipValidationMessages` or equivalent\n",

In this regard, you can place state/collections to the top level view, and reference those props & collection from the subview.  this is what the example shows.  the top level view is in the FormView's closure, so you can ref it, e.g., using the example from the README:\n\n``` js\nvar AwesomeFormView = View.extend({\n    props: {\n        a: 'state' // the state/model/collection you're interested in\n    },\n    template: '<div><p>App form</p><form data-hook=\"app-edit-form\"></form></div>',\n    render: function () {\n        this.renderWithTemplate();\n        this.form = new FormView({\n            el: this.queryByHook('app-edit-form'),\n            submitCallback: function (obj) {\n                console.dir(this.parent.a); // and here it is\n            },\n```\n\ni think. i haven't tested this :$\n",

Is this the expected behavior of clear?\n- I interpret `clear` as removal-of-value.  that would mean to set the field value to `null`, or perhaps the the empty string (not `undefined`, tho!).  admittedly, however, the case of the empty string still isn't quite baked in SelectView.  we should certainly do so soon.  `options: ['a', '', 'c']` then a `.setValue` on `''`, for example, will fail.\n",

My opinion is still that a [bulletproof](https://github.com/AmpersandJS/ampersand-form-view) form won't passively accept an error state.  If I start in an arbitrary state A, request to `reset()` to state A, yet end up in state B--that's contrary to the linguistic intent, thus arguably an error.  Passively moving to state B I think may induce user heartache in the future.  Perhaps we make this configurable?\n\n@wraithgar @kamilogorek @latentflip \nwe'd like your input on this discussion.  To summarize briefly, the discussion is simply should a `reset()` in ampersand-select-view default to the 0th-index <option> or should it throw an Error, if and when the original value is no longer present in the option set.\n",

I hope I'm not coming off rude or too picky :smile: , but...\n1. `reset` doing _nothing_ when `opts.value` isn't defined doesn't really solve my initial problem statement.  i'm still thinking that reset needs to be honest, and needs to be explicit.  Perhaps we could adjust `setValue()` to return the actual `value` vs `this` (no chaining :( ), and then in construction we modify the setValue call to look like `this.startingValue = setValue(opts.value, opts.eagerValidate ? false : true);`.  To finish it up, reset would be simply be `function() { return this.setValue(this.startingValue, true); }`.  It would break some of your tests as they stand, but at least we'd know explicitly what the startingValue really is, and reset would try to set it to it no matter what.\n2. `beforeSubmit` won't work as you have it with collections, as yieldModel, for instance, expects an object to be passed to setValue.  In your case, you're just submitting a string.\n\nI checked out your PR and did an update on it.  Solving the first issue actually led to finding some further issues, hence the ~large update.

Because of the ambiguity & uncertainty of the returned elements, &-js would not know _how_ you would like those cached.  I.e. how would your elements get stored onto obj? `this.titleSocial1`?, `this.title_social_el_0`?, etc etc. I'd recommend that you add a sugar function to do the query, and index on key definitions as you see fit.\n\nLet me know if that was unclear!  If you have an idea about a standard way to do it that could be beneficial, please share. :smile: \n",

      "body": "i've had to design around this as well.  it's definitely do-able.  in my case, i've wanted to bind listeners to an element that :dash: (whoosh) disappears :dash: once I render a view on it.  as a consequence, in a my parent's view definition, I then need to know about my child view's hooks to bind the parent view's desired handlers.  i like the `container` suggestion.\n\nmy workaround (ref'ing child hooks) _could_ admittedly be an anti-pattern.  such listeners perhaps could be bound to my child view's `el` within the child view definition, vs. the parent definition.  those listeners would have to trigger an event for the parent to listen to such that i could achieve the same behavior.  thinking out loud, this is now a weak point in that there's still an extra implicit view-relationship to manage between parent-child.\n\n`container` sounds more & more appealing as it keeps my binding, my template, and my behavior in the same place.  this is how we did it in forms for specifying a pre-existing FieldView container, @HenrikJoreteg, at your own suggestion.  Albeit we still used `el` as a target container.\n",

Major bummer!\n\n> For the rare cases where user wants to delay rendering - let him handle that in his render function (and recommend this behavior).\n\nagreed that if the group finds it too complex, its better to remove entirely, vs. keeping it and having it unreliable.  that would also require a FormView update, that thats manageable\n",

I didn't realize that the 4.0.0 tag had made it into git, so publishing the major ended up releasing 5.0.0.  `npm unpublish` won't let you re-use the version number ever again, so i can't just scrap the tags and redo the release.  your thoughts?  I could re-tidy the git tags, then npm unpublish 4.0.0 & 5.0.0, and instead go right to 4.0.1?  thinking out loud.\n",

If you need to override `initialize` and are willing to call `View.prototype.call(this)` from there too, I recommend doing so until you are more comfortable with the lib.  You don't need to, but it will likely be helpful as you're just fist learnin' it.  It will make sure you get all the other &-View goodies.\n\nwrite back with more Qs as necessary.  feel free to post a requirebin fiddle too if youd like\n",

I could perhaps reduce some of that data further.  do you know much about the what and why of the `validation` step?\n2. i have tried to get react devtools up, but it's currently out-of-order in electron, which is my target client.\n3. in regards to reselect, i'm not modifying as I select my state-bits into the component's stateToProps map.  but perhaps therein is part of the issue?  i'm still reasoning over why you'd cache in this part of the processes vs. before/conditionally dispatching an action.\n4. i will be trying pure render for sure\nthanks guys! would definitely care for some more tips if you got them!\n",

Rather than sniffing each store, it could be simpler to just maintain an aggregated set.  E.g. If you had a session var of 'bananas' and a derived var of 'grapes', `model._allProps = { grapes: 'derived', bananas: 'session' }`, or equivalent.  Then scanning everything wouldn't be such a hassle.  Just throwin' out ideas :)\n\n@pgilad,\n\n> \"whether allowing overriding &state private vars for usage in state/props/derived is the right way to go\". \n\n I don't fully understand this bit. can you clarify?\n",

      "body": "Thanks for the input @Immortalin.  The presence of a package.json is a declarative manifest stating that \"this package is defined by these characteristics and dependencies.\"  To go modify the folder structure and generate a new package.json is to declare the first package.json insufficient.  99.99 percent of projects using it specify a main script used when importing the library.  Here, that's not the case.  Further, such requirements aren't stated in the README.  I would run npm install in a repo simply by observing a package.jsons presence, as that is how it is intended to be used, if dependencies are listed.\n\nMy tone is cordial, not brash, FTR :).  Anyway, we have an automated build script that npm installs all packages with a package.json then after runs all builds that have a Gruntfile/gulp file if present.  This automated workflow is what uncovered the issue\n",

I've been toying with electron-rebuild.  as you may be aware, my node version !== electron's node version, so electron-rebuild has to recompile some modules against it's version.  I see the rebuild module doing something like `npm rebuild --target=TARGET_VERSION --arch=ARCH_VERSION`.  That doesn't seem to _reliably_ product builds to my expectation.  e.g. node v0.12.7 has `process.versions.modules` == 14, while my electron's === 44.  the above command still seems to build against 14, vs 44 like I expect.\n\nDo you have any tips on how I can best use npm to recompile against a target version?  Assume that I have the target header files already downloaded.  I need to use npm vs explicit node-gyp as there may be other lifecycle hooks that must be run for a module at install.\n\nI will gladly add to the README with pertinent docs if you can assist!\n",

      "body": "hey @remko,\n\nI don't think the team has this on the roadmap, but would certainly welcome a community module.  It could be as simple as:\n\n```\n// ampersand-mega/all/spine/agg.js\nmodule.exports = { State: require('ampersand-state'), Model: ..., Router: ... }  // eg ampersand-backbone ;)\n```\n\nWere such a module to be released, the internals & API of the aggregated package would change, and consuming APIs would still need to adapt accordingly.  What you gain is the ability to flip back-and-forth between multiple &-js modules' versions quickly.  This all-and-all would be a fine thing!  IMHO, however, the problems you noted don't really get addressed by a singleton package.   The legal teams will _still_ need to sniff _nested_ licenses.  The UI tests would still need a full sweep.\n\nI humbly believe that the best we can do as a framework team is (a) keep on top of denoting clear changelogs and (b) keep on top of writing many, diligent tests.  You've noted that changelogs _aren't_ kept.  This isn't fully true, but hasn't been rigorously followed either.  This is definitely a place for improvement.  cc @AmpersandJS/core-team for making a changelog process \"more official.\"\n\nI've written and deleted various responses to this, unable to select the right wording.  However, to summarize simply, as a fellow user, I don't believe that further simplicity or clarity is achieved by aggregation.\n\nSome specific responses to some of your bullets:\n\n> My npm-shrinkwrap.json is currently 2300 lines long, ...\n\na big project is a big project.  I think having \"many dependencies\" is unfortunate in that it generates a long list, but it's the beauty of the unix philosophy.  I _personally_ wouldn't claim that \"many dependencies\" is a strong complexity adder.\n\n> ... modules combined are all over the place: some modules depend on underscore, some on lodash.*...\n\nI hope this is not the case.  the group made a big effort to lodashify almost everything.  at least the official modules\n\n> Whenever I detect I need to upgrade a module, I'm too scared to do it these days\n\nYea, better changelogs could definitely help--I'm with you here for sure.  However, that's what semver and testing are for too, which are invalueable assets in any huge project.  sounds like yours is a pretty big one!\n\n> This greatly simplifies the dependency tree in a project using ampersand ...\n\nAt a cost.  A cost of ambiguity of purpose, and refactor-ability of the consuming code.  `¯\\_(balance)_/¯`.\n\n> Keeping track of what changes in ampersand is easier ...\n\nthis is a complicated claim.  for some us, perhaps yes.  for my usual use cases (picking and choosing a small subset), I would not think so.\n\n> It makes it easier to report global ampersand issues such as this one...\n\nI'm not confident such a thing exists (\"global ampersand issues\").  I think what you are getting at is when some change or bug affects many modules?  As a counter, wouldn't it feel _incorrect_ to post the issue in a global place versus the offending package/repo?\n\nAnyway, that's my long response to a long question.  :)  I respect your opinion as a peer and active ampersander, so I hope nothing came off brash!\n",

What I also like about using submission error is that it follows the natural control flow, then redirects the control internally within r-form.\n\nEither work.

BTW, i'm not firmly attached to my PR--i'm much more interested in coming out with the right design, so no worries if that was a concern.\n\n> We're trying to fit three options into a binary-shaped hole\n\nright.  respectfully, IMHO, the your proposed strategy still suffers the same issue.  promise api, cb api--same thing. ok ok, there are some differences, but the existence of `.promisify` or `.nodeify` are testaments to the claim :)\n\nconsider the following:\n- returning a resolved promise as a means to set form state can be dicey because of namespace conflicts. e.g. `return promiseXhr.get(url)`.  also, if the user chained on to the call, it's misleading that all was well to them.\n- using a cb strategy doesn't change the problem.  `return xhr.get(..., cb)`.  the handler will still have an empty `err` first argument.\n- returning a rejected promise doesn't work, because of the original intent of the PR--meaningful errors are swallowed\n- using a cb strategy in the error field doesn't change the problem.  `myBrokenAsyncCall(..., cb)`.  same as the rejected promise.\n\ni think the **problem lies in that we are trying to detect form error state implicitly** through a control flow which is susceptible to transmitting data of unknown types and content. \n\nif we pass in a separate method entirely to set form error state (a bound/unbound actionCreator perhaps), then all of reasoning around whether or not the operation was successfully/unsuccessful goes away--the user explicitly declares/defines it.\n\n> Validation errors: The promise is never resolved or rejected; wait for your errors to show up as props on the next process tick.\n\nthis reduces usability, and arguably introduces non-determinism.\n\ni'd like to chase something like\n\n``` js\nconst validate = (values, setErrors) => {\n  if (!values.firstName) {\n    return setErrors({\n        firstName: 'Required'\n    });\n}\n```\n\nif it's possible.\n\nwhat do you think?\n",

      "body": "> Why change the travis config to npm run lint instead of just updating the make lint target? \n\ni want to run the lint task automatically on pre-commit s.t. all contributors don't forget to lint their code manually. i could surely use the make command, but\n- it's extra overhead (i.e. runs an extra child process vs running the eslint directly), and\n- adds an extra level of indirection\n  - runs a command purely as a proxy to another command `npm => make => eslint` vs just `npm => eslint`\n  - npm scripts are already acting as a task runner--why sustain a redundant secondary task runner?\n\n> I am somewhat obsessed with GNU Make, it's one of my favorite tools\n\n`make` is great, but IMHO it's not friendly or common in the js community. if this were a `C++` library, id say rock on, but using ~~js standards~~ common js practices in a js lib seems kind of like an \"of course\" sort of thing to me.  i would lobby that make is not _as_ friendly to new contributors.\n\nit's sort of bikeshedding in the grand scheme of things. anyway, hopefully we can come to resolution\n",

Attachments ...\n\ncould be a no-op if the proxy solution was considered\n\n---\n\nto summarize again, events happen on my stores.  sync events, change events, etc.  i must cache Pouch generated emitters in my app and pass them around to those who need to listen.  a more natural feeling approach to is enable `myPouch.on(...)` like interface.  this provides simple and unified Event API for a pouch instance.\n",

We tagged all eject related commits with a🔧 emoji, and thus intended to `rebase` + `drop` them once we solved the problem!\n-  this `history` issue is most likely our problem.  thank you! it was _right there in the README_. we will patch shortly.\n- the current deployment, as you observed, is incorrect.  it is a product of my incomplete troubleshooting.  please disregard its known naughty, not-per-the-instructions state.\n  - your messages & warnings are top notch--i violated them intentionally thinking that a webpack plugin may have been at fault for not rendering my content.\n- lastly, unrelated, VisualBasic was great.  I'm glad you gave it props in that nodeup podcast a ways back.  I finally got around to listening and was happy to hear your defense of VB, as I have ~= the same story.\n\nthx again.  we will report back and close the issue out when work resumes on this project later in the week.\n",

So, the replicating client does some work, I do some assertuons, then I kill the server. Unknown to me, the replicating client had outbound requests.  Thus, killing the server ended up being problematic, and the pouch client would explode with socket errors!  Hence, this issue is specifically targeted at live replicating, sync stuff.  :).

IMHO those should remain on the user pages, not the dev pages.\n\nwhilst you're upset that I asked some repeat questions, I was disgruntled with my lack of ability to do things that I felt should be entirely obvious, but couldn't because the right docs aren't in the right place.\n\nso (genuinely) **sorry for the shade**, i'm grateful for your response, but this issue shouldn't be demoralizing, IMHO, it should be expected.\n",

[select-view](https://github.com/AmpersandJS/ampersand-select-view/blob/master/ampersand-select-view.js#L276) clears it by default.  however, to counter that, clearing by default doesn't represent a _true_ reset if validation was present on init. so 👍 \n- API.  my _personal_ pref would be for the API to be more akin to `field.clear({ validate: false })`.  more specifically, an object based argument, to ++communication/readability.  it's definitely not the status quo (shame on me!) but if this will be rippling back up to form and possibly into other fields, it may be a good opportunity to make it great 💪 \n",

Numeric identifiers always have lower precedence than non-numeric identifiers. A larger set of pre-release fields has a higher precedence than a smaller set, if all of the preceding identifiers are equal.

If you run the example you can see that even after responses are collected (prompt `run()` resolves and I have user input), you can't sigint the process.

Instead, however, the signal is swallowed as a side effect of running the prompt.  I would think such a side effect would be removed by the time the promise resovles and user input is captured",

Of the many ideas listed, deployments seems like it could offer the lowest cognitive overhead workflow, whilst maintaining deep capability, especially for those projects **where artifacts are created from multiple CI providers**.  I assume releasing with multiple CI providers _may not be?_ a 1st class support citizen for this project, but `gyp`, `neon`, `electron`, `nexe`, and other-js-projects-with-native-concerns have a lot to gain if it was supported.\r\n\r\nHypothetical workflow:\r\n\r\n- commit lands in GitHub\r\n  - CI providers race on build/tests steps only.  no _publish_ occurrs\r\n- GH app waits for CI GREENness\r\n- GH app computes if next version required, and generates tags when necessary\r\n  - event sent to CI providers, instructing to build/publish artifacts only\r\n  - one provider elected to be \"master\"\r\n    - master does npm publish, generates release notes, etc\r\n  - each provider publishes artifacts\r\n- GH app waits for all artifacts and done signal from master\r\n- GH finalizes the `semantic-release`\r\n\r\nI know that this may not be exactly what was envisioned with the GH application, but it's food for thought. thx!\r\n  ",

      "body": "I respect these points, but disagree with them for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n> You may have more than one HTML element that you want to modify.\r\n\r\nIf that is necessary, than that other element should also be exposed.  SUIR, for example, often hangs related elements off of a root element for this reason. in [this  example](https://react.semantic-ui.com/collections/form), you can see they have things like `<Form.Button />` & `<Form.XYZ />` to use instead of the defaults, if you want to override internal components with other props/goodies.\r\n\r\nIt's also worth noting that SUIR use a similar pattern to that which I've proposed, but do so via a babel plugin [ref1](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI-React/blob/c8fabc7805ad23eeeaed9ec37c128ca4d508a3aa/package.json#L92) [ref2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-transform-react-handled-props).\r\n\r\nThis plugin based approach is a more advanced solution, which is probably also worth considering.  In the PR'd case, this component is a functional stateless component, so the benefits of the plugin approach are less, but still valid--especially if we have `Component`/`PureComponent`s in RSGs component tree!\r\n\r\n> You won't accidentally leak undesired props to DOM (resting all props is dangerous).\r\n\r\nI respectfully don't think that this carries much weight.  If one has leaked a prop, he/she has done it upstream, and the bug still exists.\r\n\r\n> The API is much more clear.\r\n\r\nThe API IMHO is much less clear because it's an entirely new API to find and use.  By making it a separate API, you can't just add props to your node, like you would naturally with any other HTML tag.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks for having this discussion.  I'm not trying to be stubborn/ill-willed/etc, just advocating.  I'd still be happy to use `containerProps` over _nothing_.",

However, it does however have holes. First, many people compile to a different output dir, so a sibling is file isn't always an option.  next, `noEmit` compiler flag is used often in projects--especially projects with some ui (which Ava generally doesn't  support atm). I think the \"detect ts file > Babel with ts plugin > run\" pipeline will probably be most fruitful, so long as source maps work.  Now that were on Babel 7, I'm actually unclear on what the barriers to this are beyond file type detection :thinking: ",

      "body": "To be clear, I'd prefer MSW to not be involved at all here as well. I think we're aligned on that.  However, due to the nature of service workers and the fact that MSW is coupled to the `fetch` event, I have no choice but play nicely within MSW APIs  because I do need MSW's otherwise awesome provisions, therefore need its worker. In fact, my original desired approach was to use _a secondary worker_ to handle my requirements, which unfortunately didn't work due browser constraints. My stack is `browser-app => [huge-blackbox-of-infrastructure]`, where that blackbox is 99.99% reliable. I just happen to be making thousands of requests cumulatively on a daily basis, making that 0.01% failure rate statistically probable.\r\n\r\nIn response to the great feedback above:\r\n\r\n> You cannot affect a request at this point\r\n\r\nAgreed\r\n\r\n> The callback is called on the client, and does not have access to the worker scope (only to the worker registration).\r\n\r\nAgreed\r\n\r\n> I'm not sure if MSW is the right tool to apply a retry logic in general\r\n\r\nAgreed\r\n\r\n\r\nMy original two suggestions were\r\n\r\n> allow access to raw service worker event/request datas in onUnhandledRequest\r\n\r\n...and we're now aligned that this is not valid a solution, as these resources span across system boundaries\r\n\r\n> allow a callback directly inline in the generated MOCK_NOT_FOUND block\r\n\r\nI'm still interested in something _like_ this. I'm still interested in hooking it at the worker level specifically because it allows me to _detach_ from MSW for non-mocking concerns. By this point, MSW is already saying \"i'm not responsible for this, let the browser do its work for this fetch.\"  And, that's great--let me handle that stuff outside of MSW if MSW isn't mocking it. The proposed solution, `otherwise(...)`, above still forces me into MSW APIs and data-structures, which I'm optimistic that we can align on, specifically regarding that it feels undesirable to have to use MSW for non-mocked requests/responses.\r\n\r\nI have two ideas here that I wouldn't mind some feedback on that I think can get us out of this pickle, dare i say gracefully?\r\n\r\nOption 1: In the MSW worker, only `event.respondWith(...)` when we know 100% MSW has a mock resolver for the request. This could be achieved by letting the _worker_ do the route matching. The service worker would not need to consult the client code over the bridge to know if mocking is required. In this world, during resolver registration, matchers are sync'd to worker memory. When a `fetch` comes in, the `fetch` event handler can now synchronously choose to no-op, or, to handoff responding to the mock handlers.\r\n\r\nOption 2: in the `MOCK_NOT_FOUND` block, sniff for a userland function, e.g. `onMockNotFound(event)`. if present, call it with the event, otherwise, resume the status quo handling. \r\n\r\n\r\nBoth options _require_ that users _add code_ to the worker, either via concatenation, an `importScripts(...)` call, or _direct edits_. Anyone wanting to use worker APIs with MSW are already mostly faced with this reality, so that shouldn't be a hard stop, I wouldn't hope. I may, for example, have an entry:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// my-worker.js\r\nimportScripts(\"/myAppsWorker.js\", \"/mockServiceWorker.js\")\r\n// ^ my fetch handler or retries here!   ^ msw here!\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nOption 2 is cheap and easy. The more time I spend staring at this response the more I'm into it!",

      "body": "> ...  the client and the worker (cannot send functions) ... I describe this behavior in this comment\r\n\r\nRight. All of this behavior makes sense, including the duplication of reqs in the network tab. To be fair though, matching requests should only happening on _strings_ in msw, not functions, right? Thus, `on-string-route-match` ? `event.respondWith(...)` : `no_op`. With that said, it is probably very challenging to do matching in worker code, as it likely requires parsing GQL queries, where some fancy regex+filtering is probably all that is required for rest handlers. Because of that alone, I'm happy to remove that idea as a solution.\r\n\r\n> If I may, what puts a limitation of \"only one worker per origin is permitted\"?\r\n\r\n`serviceWorker.register(...)` by default uses the the default scope. The browser only permits one worker on a scope. If i did `serviceWorker.register(\"/msw.js\")` and `serviceWorker.register(\"/custom-app-stuff.js\")`, only one will stick, iirc. In my case, I do generally want a shared scope. I _could_ feasibly load my worker on a different scope, but would require some non-trivial path analysis.\r\n\r\n> I'm not sure you've addressed my suggestion to use a permissive handler \r\n\r\nA few reasons--`otherwise` exposes msw primitives, not worker primitives (e.g. `MockedRequest`). We want worker primitives/APIs for our use case. Further, we are retrying static assets, not just JSON/xml _data_. If I retry a `GET /something.css` or a binary, will MSW serialize that well across the bridge?\r\n\r\n> Did you consider implementing retry in this layer\r\n\r\nYa, good question. I'm actually already retrying our API calls :smile:--this effort is really for 3rd party code and bundled-framework-runtime code retrieving assets that periodically fail. Unfortunately, there are various HTTP inducing APIs that are simply out-of-reach in vendor-space. 😬 \r\n\r\n>  Perhaps consider doing this as well, as I don't find a sufficient motivation to extend the worker for this use case\r\n\r\nSure. In fact, that's what we did--edit the worker. Re: registration scope, I'd just cordially suggest that MSW \"hogs\" the worker `fetch` event, for lack of better terms. The fetch handler's more-or-less unconditional `event.respondWith(...)` suggests that if you're using MSW, then your site's service worker is all MSW or the highway. I think it's fair to assume that other _worker_ logic ought be able to play nicely with MSW.  Perhaps my case is niche enough to just say \"edit the worker for these cases\", and that's probably OK. In my above option #2, I really liked that I was able to:\r\n\r\n- ship code without editing MSW\r\n- use my worker code in tandem with MSW\r\n- load both into the same worker registration.\r\n\r\nPretty nifty traits! The API change could be just adding one conditional and call-expression:\r\n```js\r\n        case \"MOCK_NOT_FOUND\": {\r\n          if (typeof onMockNotFound === \"function\") {\r\n            return onMockNotFound(event);\r\n          } else {\r\n            return resolve(getOriginalResponse());\r\n          }\r\n```\r\n",

Observe it all in this nice GIF! I debugged on the incorrect file at first--ignore that part 😉 !\r\n\r\n![plain_old_javascript mov](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1003261/106406428-145df400-63ee-11eb-8b75-4a1060057141.gif)\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the `debugger` statement is not hit, using plain javascript, using the official recipe.  I also decided to edit the Ava source code that launches the subprocess to debug the matter further. You can see the above output that the worker is launched with `\"execArgv\": []`. Because of this, I _don't expect_ the worker to be in debug mode (unless the subprocess kicks itself into debug mode dynamically, which is certainly possible via SIGUSR1).\r\n\r\n\r\nFWIW, using the debug terminal works fine, as recommended [here](https://github.com/avajs/ava/blob/master/docs/recipes/debugging-with-vscode.md#debugging-with-the-debug-terminal). `ts-node` is certainly compatible with all of this, as suggested in the typescript docs section. Precompiled assets also are not required using the debug terminal.\r\n\r\nIt's unclear to me what the design intent is supposed to be for the launch-configuration experience (which is my preferred experience). As shown above, the recipe does _not_ kick the worker process into debug mode. Even if it did kick the child into debug mode, it's also unclear to me how one would get VSCode to listen to that child. In the prior state of ava, there was only one PID to hook into. Perhaps something like [runInBand](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli#--runinband) is in order to return the easy debug flow to the prior state?",

      "body": "> What if we print all the paths to prod dependencies in node_modules?\r\n\r\nInteresting idea. dockerfile `COPY` accepts only filenames, directories, and globs. Thus, to make such a file useful, the user would have to preprocess the deps before docker, do N fs operations (for each dep, or M - N for each dev dep), such that a single glob or directory could be prepared for `COPY`. With yarn in my large project, that's tens of thousands of fs ops--in which case just using pnpm prune would be simpler for probably similar performance. Admittedly, I don't recall how the pnpm deps are structured--some experimentation is required. This could be useful if the number of fs preparation operations is <<< than the count of dependencies.",

Why did we get this error now? All we did was add an afterEach!  And that in fact is problematic. \r\n\r\n- in the first demo, RTL `cleanup`  ran **immediately**. Jest froze the console and tore down the worker before additional work could be processed for react errors to surface\r\n- in the second demo, the async nature of our `afterEach` allowed react to continue to process state changes, specifically _outside_ of any RTL or explicit `act()` functions. our `simulateImportantTeardownWork` afterEach occurs _before_ RTLs auto-registering afterEach `cleanup`\r\n\r\nThus, what seemed like a harmless `afterEach` addition, ended up being quite problematic. Even worse--this example was designed to surface the error, by ensuring that `afterEach` was sufficiently slow to surface the act() error. In many cases, async behaviors are mocked and fast. That means that this race condition can be subtle to surface for many peoples' code. `<A />` and `<B />` effects could have certainly settled in the inner `waitFor(...)`, and no one would have been the wiser.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder matters. What happens if we register our handler, _then_ import RTL and implicitly setup the auto cleanup?\r\n\r\n```patch\r\ndiff --git a/src/__tests__/app.spec.tsx b/src/__tests__/app.spec.tsx\r\nindex 0864a78..033a93f 100644\r\n--- a/src/__tests__/app.spec.tsx\r\n+++ b/src/__tests__/app.spec.tsx\r\n@@ -1,14 +1,14 @@\r\n-import * as React from \"react\";\r\n-import { render, screen } from \"@testing-library/react\";\r\n-import { App } from \"../App\";\r\n-import { sleep } from \"../timing\";\r\n-\r\n const simulateImportantTeardownWork = () => sleep(100);\r\n \r\n afterEach(async () => {\r\n   await simulateImportantTeardownWork();\r\n });\r\n \r\n+import * as React from \"react\";\r\n+import { render, screen } from \"@testing-library/react\";\r\n+import { App } from \"../App\";\r\n+import { sleep } from \"../timing\";\r\n+\r\n test(\"cleanup & act error demo\", async () => {\r\n   render(<App />);\r\n   expect(await screen.findByText(\"A is ready\")).toBeInTheDocument();\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn test, we get:\r\n\r\n```\r\n PASS  src/__tests__/app.spec.tsx\r\n  ● Console\r\n\r\n    console.error\r\n      Warning: An update to B inside a test was not wrapped in act(...).\r\n      \r\n    ...SNIP SNIP...\r\n\r\n    console.error\r\n      Warning: Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component.

RTL's magic cleanup happened immediately, just like in the very first example we ran. Unlike in the first example, though, just by means of adding some timing delay, jest did not teardown our test quickly, and we learned that we did not appropriately clean up our effects! This could be desirable or undesirable, based on your design goals. Importantly, in this final example, at least we learned about the possibility of an error in our code.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe objective of this PR it to help the community become aware of this subtle, likely-more-common-than-reported, source of bugs because of \r\n\r\n- implicit side-effects and\r\n- async interaction between react, jest, and RTL\r\n\r\nWe should advise to ensure that `cleanup` is always called _immediately_ after the test block exits, in almost all cases. We should advise that `cleanup` certainly be called before any async behaviors, and ideally synchronously after test block exits. To not advise this is to allow for delayed cleanup, and implicitly promote act() errors to be emitted in code blocks well after where we even care about the react runtime. ",

Apologies\r\n\r\nI'm going to take an alternate approach at describing the problem.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe following script produces two cases:\r\n\r\n```txt\r\n$ tree -L 2\r\n.\r\n├── case_a\r\n│   ├── node_modules\r\n│   ├── package.json\r\n│   └── pnpm-lock.yaml\r\n├── case_b\r\n│   ├── node_modules\r\n│   ├── package.json\r\n│   └── pnpm-lock.yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"case_a\",\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"next\": \"10.0.1\",\r\n    \"react\": \"^17.0.1\",\r\n    \"react-dom\": \"^17.0.1\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"case_b\",\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"next\": \"10.0.1\",\r\n    \"react\": \"^17.0.1\",\r\n    \"react-dom\": \"^17.0.1\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"devDependencies\": {\r\n    \"prop-types\": \"15.7.2\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe only difference between these two cases is that\r\n\r\n- `prop-types` is an explicit devDependency in case_b\r\n- case_b is installed with `-P`\r\n\r\nObserve that in case_a, `prop-types` is hoisted and exists @ node_modules/prop-types.\r\nIn case_b, by passing `-P`, I'm essentially saying \"ignore devDepedencies\". In saying that, my package.json should be functionally equivalent to case_a.\r\n\r\nHowever, the physical node_modules are different.  `node_modules/prop-types` does not exist in case_b. That is _somewhat_ intuitive--prop-types _shouldn't_ be there, right? But then why was it there in case_a? What was surprising about this is that my transitive production dependency, `prop-types` _moved_ around based on the `-P` flag. It is needed in both cases--it is a production dependency in the next package. As discussed above, `prop-types` is incorrectly declared by next.js. However, I had false confidence that my application was working on my development machine, because the transitive dependency was exposed when working with a case_a setup.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to discern if `case_a`'s `node_modules/prop-types` is\r\n\r\n- desirable from pnpm's perspective, or\r\n- neutral, perhaps just an effect of the design, or\r\n- a bug\r\n\r\nNot exposing transitive dependencies I thought was a strength of pnpm. In retro, I cannot find explicit docs that state precisely this as a design goal. Anyway, it _felt_ incorrect to me, hence the report. However, if this is intentional, so be it. I would like to learn _why_, if someone knows. \r\n\r\n\r\nDemo script:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<pre>\r\nrm -rf case_a case_b \\\r\n && mkdir case_a \\\r\n && mkdir case_b \\\r\n && cd case_a \\\r\n && git init \\\r\n && npm init -y \\\r\n && pnpm add --no-optional --package-import-method=copy --save next@10.0.1 react react-dom \\\r\n && printf \"\\n\\ncase_a - node_modules\\n====\\n\\n\" \\\r\n && ls -al node_modules \\\r\n && printf \"\\n^ observe prop-types! \\n\\n\\n\" \\\r\n && cd ../case_b \\\r\n && git init \\\r\n && npm init -y \\\r\n && pnpm add --no-optional --package-import-method=copy --save next@10.0.1 react react-dom \\\r\n && pnpm add --no-optional --package-import-method=copy --save-dev prop-types@15.7.2 \\\r\n && rm -rf node_modules \\\r\n && printf \"\\n\\n\\nprepare for app for production, and install _only_ production dependencies\\n\\n\" \\\r\n && NODE_ENV=production pnpm install --no-optional --package-import-method=copy -P \\\r\n && printf \"\\n\\ncase_b - node_modules\\n====\\n\\n\" \\\r\n && ls -al node_modules \\\r\n && printf \"\\n^ observe prop-types missing \\n\\n\\n\"\r\n</pre>\r\n</details>",

      "body": "> If you aren’t releasing to opam, you don’t really need an opam file\r\n\r\nwhile true, there isn't a standard format to declare a project's dependencies otherwise. `.opam` is the defacto mechanism to declare required dependencies for a project, regardless of publishing or not.\r\n\r\n> Ephemeral information such as where to fetch the package is not part of package metadata as dune defines\r\n\r\nThis statement was surprising to me. `generate_opam_files` is all about producing for the `opam` data model. It seems to me that `generate_opam_files` should be minimally the inclusive set of opam fields, a superset if dune wants to extend it, or none at all. `dune` picking and choosing which parts of the opam spec it likes & dislikes creates a hidden implicit model, which currently is unknown to users. Perhaps [calling out that the full opam model is not supported with a big warning](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/opam.html#generating-opam-files) is worthwhile?  i had expectations of opam compatibility based on the docs. after adoption & usage of the feature, i feel mislead having now learned that the data model is some-kindof-unknown subset.\r\n\r\nnot critiquing, just sharing experience.\r\n\r\n> If you insist on using pins, ... or just writing your opam file.\r\n\r\n- I think we'd all agree using pins _stinks_. I don't think anyone ever _wants_ to do it. It's just a required flow for certain cases. i haven't started an ocaml project yet where i didn't need a pin, at least during the exploration phase. currently, I'm trying to experiment with a [jsoo-react](https://github.com/jchavarri/jsoo-react#existing-project), which explicitly calls for pinning. anytime i make a change to my project, I want to ensure that it is rapidly and easily reproducible elsewhere. this means updating a dependency declaration. this transitively means updating my dune-project, which transitively means updating my opam file. thus, pinning is a project management requirement, and `.opam` is the place to do it :/\r\n\r\n- writing your own opam file is certainly an option. i will probably take this option. however, dune should consider outright removing generation support if it cannot reflect the opam model. i really want `dune` to be the place for this though. the fewer tools i need to engage with for managing my ocaml projects the better.\r\n- i strongly challenge the suggestion that opam mixing installation source metadata is a mistake. `opam`'s role is to install dependencies into an environment. package location is just another input to that core functionality, which just by happenstance is configured with sensible defaults, pointing to the formal public repository. most adjacent programming communities let you specify the registry to install from with their associated dependency tools. [py](https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/4175), [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/registry), [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#specifying-dependencies-from-other-registries), java tools like gradle let you partition your dependency sources as well. [yarn has a decent justification section too](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/selective-version-resolutions/#toc-why-would-you-want-to-do-this). dune claiming \"this is a bad practice\" i think is not considering the diverse set of ways developers use ocaml tools.\r\n\r\n",

If any chrome wizards lurk in here, we attempted to use the TestCafe (TC) \"custom\" testcafe browser, multiplex the chromium output, capture `chrome.log` & stdio from the foreground chrome process, but it didn't prove super useful because we were unable to get log content from tabs/windows: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66926607/how-can-i-run-chromium-in-the-foreground-and-capture-native-and-webview-logs . If we can reliably get tab level, network level, and window level events from the chromium cli & emitted logs, such information could perhaps improve robustness in the TC workflow.\r\n\r\nThe TestCafe initialization process can improve robustness, now, by changing the synchronization mechanisms executed between the browser process & node runner.\r\n\r\nCurrent process:\r\n\r\n- TC launches chrome, pointing to a page\r\n- Chrome loads page\r\n- Page does I/O w/ TC server\r\n- Page processes init scripts, reporting back to server on each completion via POST\r\n- POST handler allows test execution to resume\r\n\r\nA more robust approach would be:\r\n\r\n- TC launches chrome\r\n- TC immediately gets a CDP handle \r\n- TC injects serialized init scripts into chrome, using request/response control flow\r\n\r\nCurrently, various effects are executed & coordinate by careful alignment of assets.  Success is achieved by optimistically expecting that each downstream, uncontrolled effect executes successfully. It is dangerous to pass ownership of initialization control flow to chrome, and chrome to the embedded webapp, as TC does not have hooks into _either_ of these systems by the time `runInitScripts` is called. TC launches chrome, passes a URL, &  🤞 wishes both chrome and the downstream web-app the best of luck.  What if TC managed the whole init process, vs implicitly marshaling that responsibility to these other (generally reliable, but currently failing) entities?\r\n\r\nCurrent process (pseudo):\r\n```\r\nlet testCafeWindowIsReadyDeferred = ... <actually implemented via initScriptsQueue>\r\nTC (system 1) creates readiness deferred\r\nTC launches Chrome (system 2)\r\nChrome tries to load a web app (system 3) \r\nWeb-app attempts to _do lots of work_ in the window, which hopefully eventually lands a POST call into system 1, which settles the deferred\r\nREADY\r\n```\r\n\r\nPossible future:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTC (system 1) launches chrome (system 2)\r\nTC navigates chrome to idle page (resolve/reject)\r\nTC injects script, gets response (resolve/reject)\r\n...loop, until all init scripts settled\r\nREADY\r\n```\r\n\r\n",

Without this ability to reduce stats.json,\r\n\r\n- it's difficult analyze a page's JS graph, as the rest of the app's chunks create a high noise:signal ratio in forensic tools, like those mentioned above\r\n- it's difficult to analyze nearly any stats at all, as in our case the stats.json file is 400MB+ (probably ways to tune that down), and the analyse web-app doesn't do super hot with giant datas. i may look into optimizations over there\r\n\r\n",

So what we ended up doing was just creating a brand new application, then that application _is_ our server. We never run next directly, we only run our server. That server imports the next JS app handler, configures it, and specifically points it to our next JS application files. So essentially we have two apps, and the server app points to the next JS app, and it all works fine. And this is made possible only by the fact that there is a `dir: ...` flag supported by next. On the phone, so sorry if that didn't make perfect sense. Having the server as an app and having the nextJS nrwl as an app ended up being a clean solution, albeit it comes with a little bit of indirection, as at the end of the day, they both ultimately end up being run as the same process.",

It was the mere thought that I have existing, valid code to do the mapping, of which I had to re-express in a _different format_ to achieve the same result.\r\n\r\nI'd like to learn more about the worker remarks. Are these values always computed from within a worker? I suppose that could make sense given the computational complexity of maps, generally. I find this to be a **compelling** argument. It likely does _not_ make sense to send data back and forth over a bridge for derivation with sufficiently large datasets.  If the data derivation happened in the main thread in batched RAFs, then was streamed into the worker, then I think my suggestion would be worth further thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n> I fear that it would significantly impact performance\r\n\r\nYes, footgunning could be abound. with freedom comes responsibility. I personally believe that developer friendly APIs are of greater importance in this specific scenario. But that's my own biases :)\r\n\r\n\r\n> add rigidity by exposing some of the internal abstractions\r\n\r\nAgreed. Counter-point, versioning schemes more or less negate that risk, and pragmatically one would not expect too much thrash here, as the essential datamodels of interest (warning, naivety ahead) seem to largely be  GeoJSON models. When GeoJSON schemas thrash, I imagine consumers are already bound to some-sort-of-code-migration. I.o.w. `(feature: GeoJSON.Feature{v1,v2,v3,...,vn}) => string` is probably a low API surface area, low-trash interface to have deep concern over.\r\n\r\n> would diverge from the consistency and portability that Mapbox tries hard to offer\r\n\r\nYes, it would diverge. This is certainly a gut feel kind of decision. A decision of art, wisdom, and preference. If the goal is to create a mapping from `value => value`, intrinsically, a function is precisely that. For the sake of cross-platform consistently (certainly relevant for many users) creating a DSL to declaratively model a function can be beneficial. I would argue, however, that it makes mapbox cumbersome on a _core feature_, thus less delightful to use. In no case would I advocate for removing the status-quo functionality--your argument is completely valid. However, for those of us for which the x-platform interface provides little value and adds friction, I personally would support _both_ mechanisms just to apply grease to the wheels for scenarios where developers observe unnecessary friction.",

Runtime solutions cost a moderate amount of JavaScript, suffer extra blocking downloads (language message pack), or have naive namespace splitting of the locale corpus.\r\n\r\nmy solution was to write a webpack loader to:\r\n\r\n- at devtime, render messages using the developer requested locale\r\n- At prod build time, split into two steps:\r\n    - where text or a text function is used, instead of providing the locale message of interest, inject that message from ALL locales, in some structured format\r\n    - copy the app that has all locales into a locale specific folder of interest (eg apps/en-US), then reduce the embedded message to just the locale of interest, stripping the other locales out of the assets.\r\n    - If you are doing static only builds, you may be able to do this much easier/less-complexity, and dodge this two step malarkey to get locale aware messages into the correct assests.\r\n\r\n\r\nBenefits:\r\n\r\n- no runtime overhead or complexity. Very simple—nearly like developing an app for a single language \r\n- best possible performance for browsers\r\n\r\nChallenges:\r\n\r\n- build time complexity. extra processing, uncommon architecture \r\n- lots of files? App artifacts are multiplied by N locales. Thus, cost on CDNs may be higher 🤷‍♀️\r\n",

Yes, the entrypoints are now symmetric--I see the entrypoint on both views (the entrypoint view showing the module, and the module view showing the entrypoint)\r\n2. I am still seeing a module present in statoscope which is not bundled anywhere. I was hoping statoscope would help show me the mapping between module => entrypoint => asset, but currently it just tells me what entrypoint the module belongs to. I may need to provide some better information here to solve the issue.  Regardless, the TLDR is that the foam graph says `use-delete-list-item.ts` is in use in the entrypoint, the module page even shows reasons (which appear incorrect, but that may be a webpack issue not a statoscope issue??), and ultimately that module has _no content_ in any of the assets used for the entrypoint. So, it's puzzling. The tools are telling me a module is used in some capacity somewhere in my entrypoint--but it is 100% not.",

The big missing big is that the _scans_ PDFs from DEQ need to be auto-generated post clone.

How many bytes saved?\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimplNotUsingParams(function functionThatCouldBeErased () {\r\n  // how many bytes are saved would be\r\n  // equal to however many bytes terser\r\n  // could compress this function down to.\r\n  // I'm passing this CB to a function that won't use it\r\n  // so the MAX_BYTES_SAVED can be quite high.\r\n  // sizeOfFn.toString().length bytes :)\r\n}, plusThis, ...andThese)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the case that prompted this issue, pumping my fn implementation into a minifier, it was ~300-400 bytes. Could be a single byte, could be a megabyte!\r\n\r\n\r\n2. On optimization passes\r\n\r\n> The tricky part is keeping track of how many times something was called. Specifically,\r\n> process.env.NODE_ENV === “production” ? implNotUsingParams : implUsingParams`\r\n\r\nI used this as an example, but in actuality, I get into these scenarios with upstream build tools, such as webpack/etc. By the time this snippet makes it to terser, it is reduced to:\r\n\r\n- `\"production === \"production\" ? implNotUsingParams : implUsingParams`, or \r\n- `true  ? implNotUsingParams : implUsingParams` \r\n\r\ni'm not sure certain which one is more likely. \r\n\r\nThis simplified input to terser may or may not reduce the need for a multi pass. I would opt in to pay the runtime cost for a multi pass reduction if it meant support for the feature. Speed matters 101%. Browser bytes is something I prioritize even higher than build speed.\r\n\r\n> In the case where Terser can turn a function call into an IIFE\r\n\r\nThanks. Ya, this is a different case indeed. This fn could be called many times, but the inputs are _known to do nothing_, so we can save!\r\n\r\n> There's lots of things Terser doesn't do, because it's hard to maintain a lot of working features,\r\n\r\nYa, I appreciate that. I additionally acknowledge that this could be argued as an edge case as well.\r\n\r\nFor me, the driving motivation is really supporting a development and production workflow in my JS projects. Were it not for this objective, I would not end up with the seemingly obscure code as @TimvdLippe & @jridgewell pointed out. To implement this feature is to implicitly support browser patterns where implementations are swapped based on build targets. That may not be a goal of this project, or even a consideration to tailor towards.\r\n\r\nIn development, we load different features into the application than we do at production time. Extra config, plugins, widgets, etc are loaded into our applications to enhance the developer experience. By the time we go to production, none of that is needed, and we desire to strip it out. For static resources, dead-code-elim is great. `isProd ? prodImpl : devImpl` strips out `devImpl`, and everyone is happy! However, it just gets a bit messier when your resources are composed with other resources, e.g. \r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst a = resource => isProd ? prodImpl : devImpl(resource)  // devImpl dead-code-elim'd\r\nconst b = a(resource) // resource param IS NOT dead-code-elim'd\r\n```\r\n I can _definitely_ handle all this in userland code:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst a = resource => isProd ? prodImpl : devImpl(resource) // devImpl dead-code-elim'd\r\nconst b = isProd ? a() : a(resource) // resource param IS dead-code-elim'd\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe downside to handling it in userland code (in fn `b`) as demonstrated is that _it's redundant_. I **already expressed my production optimization** in fn `a`, but now must force it onto my customer who is defining function `b`. Not a problem--the caller should probably be aware of browser impact. However, it's certainly _more_ desirable if I can handle that conditionality once and let the compiler work its optimization to handle the rest.\r\n\r\nFood for thought. Please feel empowered to close the issue if we do not want to pursue further, otherwise I am happy to continue the dialog.\r\n",

It is not unreasonable to assume that consumers of `A` have explicit business logic coded around `A`s contract, which changing `A` violates.",

The status quo is implicitly an isomorphic case--support javascript running in node or browser.\r\n- If there is a `target_env` specific implementation available specified by an `//If: <target_env>` annotation, allow it to _override_ the isomorphic case. In `fs_node.js`, for example, i provided empty impls for the browser. This should be fine and good, as these functions should _never_ be invoked, as someone targeting the browser should never be calling a FS API. Someone will undoubtedly try, and the will get the all-too-familiar `cannot call FIELD_NAME of undefined` error :).  This is an acceptable/desirable state.\r\n- Update the `fragment` data model to included the `annot`ation list, so we can conditionally swap the target_env implementations",

Offering a single command to fully hydrate a developer environment I think is a fantastic development UX that I would have certainly used to get started.

I'm going to answer your questions, but out of order :)\r\n\r\n> ... not immediately clear to me what the end goal of getMissingFeatures would be?\r\n\r\nMy ultimate objective is to support building an intelligent, targeted polyfill, programatically. Implementing `getMissingFeatures` is part of that puzzle.\r\n\r\nPractically speaking, I need to solve the below equation for `Features_to_polyfill`. Without solving this equation, I cannot build a sensible polyfill automatically, with confidence.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar Features_to_polyfill = \r\n   Features_used_by_app -  // known (user-space)\r\n   Features_supported_by_compiler - // known (user-space)\r\n   Features_not_in_browser // **getMissingFeatures(browser, version)**\r\n```\r\n\r\n**`getMissingFeatures(browser, version)` provides `Features_not_in_browser`**, which is otherwise missing.\r\n\r\nDoes that make sense? I prevent some features from being used in my application, generally via things like lint rules. My compiler (babel) down-levels some language features, which I also know about. So, if those two sets of features are known, I want to be able say \"hey, what leftover features that I am using need to be polyfilled?\". As you noted, the list can be enormous! This is a positive trait--I want to consider each and every one of these entities, and either A) forbid the feature in my application, or B) include it in my polyfill set! Perhaps, `Features_excluded_from_app` get's derived from this value, and added into the above equation.\r\n\r\nThis helps me protect my users by not using unsupported features, or, helps by polyfilling only where needed. Without `getMissingFeatures()`, I cannot produce the list of features I want to polyfill reliably. This process has **already** helped me by forcing me to go consider what INTL APIs I will/will not need to support!\r\n\r\n\r\nOn your range notes, i'll defer conversation there. Thanks for that. I need to get a bit more free time and dwell on those",

      "body": "Hey all! Sorry for all the noise today--lots of features and discussion :)\r\n\r\nBig 👍 to this topic. I'd advocate to advance the recommendation much further. There is additional simplicity and maintenance reduction to be had here. Rather than just align the names, I'd propose that we fully integrate with caniuse-lite.\r\ncaniuse-lite can drive:\r\n\r\n- browser names convention\r\n- all of the support compatibility ranges, currently provided by hand in the toml files\r\n\r\nCanIUse lite has an API that can provide these browser compatibility tables, and be self maintaining by just bumping the dependency over time. Rather than maintain _two_ datasets for mapping `feature => browser-compat` in the community, we could just take advantage of the great work they are already doing over there.\r\n\r\nHere's roughly what the API looks like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst ciul = require('caniuse-lite')\r\nconst { features } = require('caniuse-lite/dist/unpacker/features')\r\nconsole.log(ciul.feature(features.abortcontroller))\r\n/**\r\n{\r\n  status: 'ls',\r\n  title: 'AbortController & AbortSignal',\r\n  stats: {\r\n    ie: {\r\n      '6': 'n',\r\n      '7': 'n',\r\n      '8': 'n',\r\n      '9': 'n',\r\n      '10': 'n',\r\n      '11': 'n',\r\n      '5.5': 'n'\r\n    },\r\n    edge: {\r\n      '12': 'n',\r\n      '13': 'n',\r\n   ... snip snip\r\n*/\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, no need to maintain the toml config--just query the CIUL db package. I think this would be particularly awesome, because it allows users (like me!) to have a unified set of tools, aligning to same conventions and datasets, to deliver a cohesive browser compatibility strategy. Currently, the misaligment between these tools induces a bit of friction, albeit navigable.",

      "title": "Generic Settings Loader",
      "body": "# Generic Settings Loader\n## Background\n\nI have two features in development, separate from this PR, that involve accessing OctoPrint settings.  I feel that the settings protocol is a little clunky in current state, and disliked that the settings must be explicitly and redundantly called out in the code.  This PR serves to make getting/setting of settings simpler exclusively for the developer.  I foolishly branched from foosel/master instead of foosel/devel, so I'd like to request to do the PR now, then after issues are settled, perform the conflict resolution.  This is a **large** PR, so I would be happy to annotate it heavily to help the review process OR schedule time to review together online.\n## Changed Setting Loading Behavior\n### Server Side\n1. Made the get/set methods **generic** in the Settings class and the Settings API.  I.e., just call `get()` vs. `getInt/getBool/etc`.  Uses new function `coercePrimative()` to infer native type when passed js stringified IO.  Additionally this permits us to reduce the number of times all of the settings are explicity laid out in each file (from 4x => 2x [1x for server 1x for client].  Perhaps a package build process can reduce this need further as Python Dictionary and js Object syntax are ~equivalent.\n2. Server ajax set/get \"all\" functions now use a generic setting **iterator**, vs. explicity calling out each setting.\n3. To facilitate the above, the default settings are intially broken into two dictionaries. 1) settings usable and exposed to the client, then 2) another dictionary that is not exposed to the client.  They are zipped back into a single default_settings variable on init.  The ajax getters/setters determine which properties to send by looking at the client dictionary.\n### Client Side\n1. Similair to server, I have listed settings for client only once in settings.js, then **auto-generate ko observables** (commonly listed as `koos`).\n   _This means you must only add your new setting to settings.py and settings.js a single time per file, and your new setting is accessible on server and client!_\n### Helpers\n\n`eachDeep()` and `dict_merge()` were introduced in collectionUtils.py as a means to recurse through the settings and to zip dictionaries together, respectively.\n## Updated folder setting loading scheme\n\nBecause folder get/set functions are reliant on getBaseFolder/setBaseFolder (file IO), the the batch get/set of the ajax requests couldn't be handled without special cases.\nTo permit using the generic functions and still update the folders properly:\n1. Auto create the default folders on load via setUserDirs()\n2. After the ajax set is executed, run setUserDirs() again to build the new dir immediately.\n\n```\nNote--the *pre-existing* upload feature has a bug wherein if you change the upload dir, you must restart the server for the change to take place.  I will have a follow up PR to resolve this.\n```\n## General\n1. Linted js -- fixed syntax errors (missing ;'s, == vs. ===, etc)\n2. Alphabetized all settings dictionaries (server) & objects (client) for consistency\n3. Alphabetized some file's member functions for readability (settings.js)\n4. **Unified setting names between client and server**\n",

On initialization, I had set an initial `rendered` state on the view, forgetting that it would emit an event!  this PR serves to set that state, but in a _silent_ manner.  Tests updated.\n",

However, we could instead listen for the specific `not found` error:\n\n``` bash\ncdieringer@Snapper-osx:~/node/pouchdb$ node\n> require('abcd')\nError: Cannot find module 'abcd'\n```\n# test discussion\n\nit's a tricky one to write tests for, as it requires different prebuilt leveldown versions.  not sure if folks think it's a worthwhile thing to test.  regardless, i installed pouch with node 0.12.7, ran the tests (pass), switched to iojs 2.5.0, ran the tests, and confirmed that the helpful error was present:\n\n<img width=\"544\" alt=\"1_tests_pass\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1003261/10409498/fc3195aa-6ed7-11e5-8ba1-496c0c112d9f.png\">\n<img width=\"534\" alt=\"2_switch_to_iojs\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1003261/10409499/fc33d356-6ed7-11e5-8a00-b6f3a9d7e9b0.png\">\n<img width=\"683\" alt=\"3_observe_new_error\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1003261/10409500/fc344bb0-6ed7-11e5-888e-3968f236981d.png\">\n",

See [here](http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/api/error-management-configuration.html#global-rejection-events) for ref.\n- error handlers are not commonized between `uncaughtException` and `unhandledRejection`\n- some log activity is silenced because logger is not registered early enough\n- redundant logging activity occurs per long design discussion in #44 \n- #56\n# solution\n- primarily, address #44.  the other issues simply get bundled in as consequence\n- close #56\n- tidy index.js.  you will see a lot of RED. open it in just raw mode.  enjoy it's simplicity! :)\n# discussion\n- note the new content that shows up when you run the api.  that should have been present the whole time!\n- note how we never error, log, then throw again.  this is **antipattern**.  throw, log, and crash.  OR, throw, recover, optionally log, continue\n  - if you are _not_ going to recover, don't `try` wrap or `.catch` wrap.  no recovery means non-deterministic state, and the global error handlers which log and kill should kick in.\n",

      "body": "**Summary**\r\n\r\n# problem statement\r\n\r\n- yarn@24 bundles the CLI, removing entry points & usability from the tool.\r\n  - for instance, i wrote [parse-yarn-lock](https://www.npmjs.com/package/parse-yarn-lock), which (used to) use `yarn`'s very own [lockfile parser](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/blob/master/src/lockfile/parse.js), to be used for a variety of reasons.  in version 24, the parser is now bundled, and cut off from external access.\r\n\r\n<!-- Is the feature a substantial feature request? Please use https://github.com/yarnpkg/rfcs -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain the **motivation** for making this change. What existing problem does the pull request solve? -->\r\n\r\nIn my described use case, it is logical to use the _very same parser_ rather than an independent parser.  There's no value in duplicate tooling, and integrity/quality of the operation can suffer if using an alternative.  Some may challenge that exposing such functionality is out of scope for this project.  However, I would argue that exposing internals is a big enabler and comes with a very low cost + cost-of-ownership.\r\n\r\n# solution\r\n\r\n- incrementally expose some internal APIs so `yarn` can be used programmatically.  `YARN_AS_LIB` tells the entry point to expose the library by default, vs executing the CLI.\r\n\r\n**Test plan**\r\n\r\n- an integration test could be done to call into the library from a shell, although im not seeing such test code in `__tests__` ATM, and i figured core maintainers would have a preference on how to execute such a test.\r\n\r\n# review\r\n\r\n**review with `?w=1` in the URL such that github more cleanly displays the very few changes.  https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/pull/3397/files?w=1**\r\n\r\n![yarn-as-lib mov](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1003261/26028300/7a7053ec-37d2-11e7-81c7-ba70561c39bc.gif)\r\n\r\n",

I do _not_ want to bundle my full `node_modules`, as I have a monorepo and my dependency stack has all sorts of _other_ stuff in it. One way to keep my size down would be to _know_ what top level application dependencies my application is using, and use that to reduce my node_modules footprint. Such an effort would require webpack stats exposed\r\n  - Ideally, there could be some customization to the server bundling process [see help request #13916](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/13916) to simply _not externalize_ things in `node_modules`.\r\n  - Next uses a moderately _complex_ server bundling/externalizing algorithm, (see `packages/next/build/webpack-config.ts`), so adding support _here_ would be strongly preferred :)\r\n\r\nThis PR in the current state is more-or-less a proposal, not targeted at acceptance. We're this feature accepted, clearly documentation and tests would need to accompany :)",

      "body": "# Problem\r\n\r\nOur tests implement an `afterEach(async () => { /* ... */ })` handler. We registered it, thinking all was well! However, jest processes afterEach handlers in reverse order of registration. That means that our integration test execute, effects could be outstanding due to interactions in the test, the test block exits, our `afterEach` _perhaps_ take a little bit of time to complete, the react effects settle from the integration test, and an `act()` error is emitted because cleanup() has not yet been invoked. Only until after our `afterEach` promise settles does RTL `cleanup()` get invoked, prompting effect teardown/cancellation, etc.\r\n\r\nWe wrote code that makes it s.t. `act()` errors fail our tests. With the above scenario also in play, we found our tests to have some degree of flakiness in noisy/inconsistent environments (like a busy CI agent).\r\n\r\nThe implicit behavior of RTL, I found, was actually undesirable. If I had known `cleanup` was a RTL provision in play just by importing the library, perhaps I would have more rapidly identified it as a potential culprit in our failures. Generally, side-effects as imports can be risky, with general exception when you explicitly import a verb, like `babel/register`, etc. I think this library should consider making this behavior explicit.\r\n\r\nI suspect other community members have periodic act() errors that they consider ghosts in the system, when perhaps they really need to look at their own `afterEach()` handlers!\r\n\r\nLet's warn those users! :)",

This helped me identify #36 ..., which really was two problems, the primary one being my copy of `jsoo` segfaulting 😆 \r\n- ...and 😬 😬 😬 , I accidentally ran [prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier) on VSCode project. In case you are not aware, `prettier` is the `ocamlformat` of JS. I am willing to undo the prettier format, but there is not an explicit style guide or formatter listed for the JS. Much like OCaml is all in on `ocamlformat`, so too do i like to \"never discuss\" formatting in changesets. Given that I did it and it's just a single file, I added prettier to devDeps in case you are interested in adopting it? Let me know",

Specifically, it assumes that `-r <THIS_MODULE>` is available for resolution by node. `pnpm`, for instance, will _not_ create `node_modules/source-map-support` in the top level, because it does not expose transitive dependencies. This isn't strictly a pnpm problem--but rather an incorrect expression of required dependencies in `packages/node/package.json`. I suspect other package managers may not guarantee this dependency in the same path either.  The common package managers (yarn, npm) in their default configurations _will_ write `node_modules/source-map-support`, so it works for 99% of folks, but nonetheless, does not work for all.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n- works, regardless of your package manager\r\n\r\n## Related Issue(s)\r\n\r\nFixes #\r\n",
