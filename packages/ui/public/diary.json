I could look into that but am unsure on the ramifications to motor health.  I am using pololu's.  I really don't think this is the solution based on the fact that most prints are healthy\n3. No endstop errors.\n4. Yes, decent stationary torque and recommend motors on the wiki\n\nSkipped steps are not the status quo.  Rather, they tend to show up on thin features when the x or y axis oscillates back and forth & high speeds/frequencies.  I believe this is when i occasionally drop a step.  I wrote a brute force algorithm in the sprinter experimental github to force the head to stay stationary for x milliseconds on a direction change to alleviate such 'jerk.'  I was excited to see that someone was trying to put nophead's frequency reduction algorithm in Marlin--that's exactly what i wanted!\n\nHowever, i may bring my accel back up & keep my jerk low.\n",

I've actually gone as far as repositioning my head as you've described, setting absolute coords via GCODE, then deleting my .gcode file's line 1 thru line ##,### and simply hitting 'print' after setting the temp.  It worked pretty dang well!  It was a mendelMax plate for a friend.  However, it was clearly imperfect and had showed an obvious jog.\n\nThe ability to repeatably reposition a head after a failure I believe is _so_ difficult that it may not warrant SW dev activity.\n",

Is there anything we could do feasibly by making the DOM element `observable` somehow?  To summarize\n- No proper change events from external components + with sloppy `.input` change detection === biased/lagging state.  This is an edge-case, but likely a **common one** outside of my own dev work\n- Not all forms need the input value for state (mine included), but said form does need an honest value at submission.  `myValue.input` return value as it stands === misleading `myInput.value` return/behavior\n",

Any subsequent bindings must attach to the rendered ampersand FieldView input.\n2) Let me use my own input el, and still attache the templated validation message nodes\n3) Let me use my own input el, but force me to provide additional validation message nodes\n\nI pursued option 2.  After our last conversation and another I've been having with wraithgar, maybe we want to scrap this, but provide another `attr` that can _easily identify the input_ such that my managing form can conveniently query into the FieldView and do additional bindings/activity to the input.\n",

      "body": "the problem with the SelectView is as follows. when the SelectView is initialized, this.value is set to null. If you provide a nully `value: xzy` to the constructor, then `.validate()` will never get called. The result is that when the form `checkValid()`, `.valid` is undefined on the SelectView, thus the form is invalid. Providing a null value is a realistic case. For example, I am querying for a value, and sometimes, that value doesn't exist. validate() won't be called because of this line in setValue(), triggered by the constructor, https://github.com/cdaringe/ampersand-select-view/blob/master/ampersand-select-view.js#L181 . I think the solution is perhaps to either:\n1. set this.value to undefined, which could potentially still result in the same failiure mode\n2. set an init flag or force flag to force setValue() down through .validate() no matter what at least once. In this regard the .valid property will always be set to a bool initially, vs now, where it can be undefined\n3. eliminate the if (value === this.value) return; in setValue().  This is what i have done in my branch for the time being\n\nInputView works a completely different way and has a different structure, otherwise I'd say let's just copy that over.\n",

I understand that the intent of your question is how to get your API to return a result formatted a particular way, based on how you request it.  really, it's not related to `ampersand-select-view`, despite you asking if a server has similar functionality.  that's OK, but you'll probably want to dig through this issue in a forum more suited to API design.  however, keeping in helpful spirit, what the server does is entirely dependent on how the API you are using is designed _on the server_.  ampersand cannot control what the server gives back to the client--it can only SEND and RECEIVE, and hopefully whatever you have sent is reciprocated with something you want to receive!\n3. if the object you got back is raw, make sure that you've defined a corresponding `state` or `model` definition for the `app.objects` collection.  I'd suppose this is a large source of your issue\n4. additionally, check out https://github.com/ampersandjs/ampersand-state#parse to see how to mutate results from the server.\n\nI think this issue can be closed :+1:   Good luck!\n",

As such, with my [3.0.0 proposal](https://github.com/AmpersandJS/ampersand-select-view/pull/34) (thanks for the review by the way), rather than _validate_ on construction, simply don't accept invalid options--period.  setting an invalid option is an application design error, so error out!\n\n@wraithgar, on \"what are we listening for\".  My thought process begins with \"what's the purpose of this field-view\"?  It's to produce a quality, validated value from the select control, per the designer's intent.  Therefore, I would suggest that we listen for any activity within our micro-DOM that impacts that `value`.  All other activity within the module orbits around it.  Thoughts?\n",

It mashes with a tiny bit with your great updates, so I'd plan on getting your stuff merged first, before requesting the community to look at mine.\n@erd0s, see [this line in your code](https://github.com/AmpersandJS/ampersand-select-view/pull/24/files#diff-cd18a4507088002c17b5ed65ce48e6c1R204) .  If the field doesn't validate immediately, `this.valid` doesn't get set, and the parent FormView won't know if the field is valid or not.  I believe your intent is not to show the messages, vs. determine the validity.  thus, see what I did [here in my PR](https://github.com/AmpersandJS/ampersand-select-view/pull/36/files#diff-cd18a4507088002c17b5ed65ce48e6c1R212).  `skipValidate` should really be `skipValidationMessages` or equivalent\n",

In this regard, you can place state/collections to the top level view, and reference those props & collection from the subview.  this is what the example shows.  the top level view is in the FormView's closure, so you can ref it, e.g., using the example from the README:\n\n``` js\nvar AwesomeFormView = View.extend({\n    props: {\n        a: 'state' // the state/model/collection you're interested in\n    },\n    template: '<div><p>App form</p><form data-hook=\"app-edit-form\"></form></div>',\n    render: function () {\n        this.renderWithTemplate();\n        this.form = new FormView({\n            el: this.queryByHook('app-edit-form'),\n            submitCallback: function (obj) {\n                console.dir(this.parent.a); // and here it is\n            },\n```\n\ni think. i haven't tested this :$\n",

Is this the expected behavior of clear?\n- I interpret `clear` as removal-of-value.  that would mean to set the field value to `null`, or perhaps the the empty string (not `undefined`, tho!).  admittedly, however, the case of the empty string still isn't quite baked in SelectView.  we should certainly do so soon.  `options: ['a', '', 'c']` then a `.setValue` on `''`, for example, will fail.\n",

My opinion is still that a [bulletproof](https://github.com/AmpersandJS/ampersand-form-view) form won't passively accept an error state.  If I start in an arbitrary state A, request to `reset()` to state A, yet end up in state B--that's contrary to the linguistic intent, thus arguably an error.  Passively moving to state B I think may induce user heartache in the future.  Perhaps we make this configurable?\n\n@wraithgar @kamilogorek @latentflip \nwe'd like your input on this discussion.  To summarize briefly, the discussion is simply should a `reset()` in ampersand-select-view default to the 0th-index <option> or should it throw an Error, if and when the original value is no longer present in the option set.\n",

I hope I'm not coming off rude or too picky :smile: , but...\n1. `reset` doing _nothing_ when `opts.value` isn't defined doesn't really solve my initial problem statement.  i'm still thinking that reset needs to be honest, and needs to be explicit.  Perhaps we could adjust `setValue()` to return the actual `value` vs `this` (no chaining :( ), and then in construction we modify the setValue call to look like `this.startingValue = setValue(opts.value, opts.eagerValidate ? false : true);`.  To finish it up, reset would be simply be `function() { return this.setValue(this.startingValue, true); }`.  It would break some of your tests as they stand, but at least we'd know explicitly what the startingValue really is, and reset would try to set it to it no matter what.\n2. `beforeSubmit` won't work as you have it with collections, as yieldModel, for instance, expects an object to be passed to setValue.  In your case, you're just submitting a string.\n\nI checked out your PR and did an update on it.  Solving the first issue actually led to finding some further issues, hence the ~large update.

Because of the ambiguity & uncertainty of the returned elements, &-js would not know _how_ you would like those cached.  I.e. how would your elements get stored onto obj? `this.titleSocial1`?, `this.title_social_el_0`?, etc etc. I'd recommend that you add a sugar function to do the query, and index on key definitions as you see fit.\n\nLet me know if that was unclear!  If you have an idea about a standard way to do it that could be beneficial, please share. :smile: \n",

      "body": "i've had to design around this as well.  it's definitely do-able.  in my case, i've wanted to bind listeners to an element that :dash: (whoosh) disappears :dash: once I render a view on it.  as a consequence, in a my parent's view definition, I then need to know about my child view's hooks to bind the parent view's desired handlers.  i like the `container` suggestion.\n\nmy workaround (ref'ing child hooks) _could_ admittedly be an anti-pattern.  such listeners perhaps could be bound to my child view's `el` within the child view definition, vs. the parent definition.  those listeners would have to trigger an event for the parent to listen to such that i could achieve the same behavior.  thinking out loud, this is now a weak point in that there's still an extra implicit view-relationship to manage between parent-child.\n\n`container` sounds more & more appealing as it keeps my binding, my template, and my behavior in the same place.  this is how we did it in forms for specifying a pre-existing FieldView container, @HenrikJoreteg, at your own suggestion.  Albeit we still used `el` as a target container.\n",

Major bummer!\n\n> For the rare cases where user wants to delay rendering - let him handle that in his render function (and recommend this behavior).\n\nagreed that if the group finds it too complex, its better to remove entirely, vs. keeping it and having it unreliable.  that would also require a FormView update, that thats manageable\n",

I didn't realize that the 4.0.0 tag had made it into git, so publishing the major ended up releasing 5.0.0.  `npm unpublish` won't let you re-use the version number ever again, so i can't just scrap the tags and redo the release.  your thoughts?  I could re-tidy the git tags, then npm unpublish 4.0.0 & 5.0.0, and instead go right to 4.0.1?  thinking out loud.\n",

If you need to override `initialize` and are willing to call `View.prototype.call(this)` from there too, I recommend doing so until you are more comfortable with the lib.  You don't need to, but it will likely be helpful as you're just fist learnin' it.  It will make sure you get all the other &-View goodies.\n\nwrite back with more Qs as necessary.  feel free to post a requirebin fiddle too if youd like\n",

I could perhaps reduce some of that data further.  do you know much about the what and why of the `validation` step?\n2. i have tried to get react devtools up, but it's currently out-of-order in electron, which is my target client.\n3. in regards to reselect, i'm not modifying as I select my state-bits into the component's stateToProps map.  but perhaps therein is part of the issue?  i'm still reasoning over why you'd cache in this part of the processes vs. before/conditionally dispatching an action.\n4. i will be trying pure render for sure\nthanks guys! would definitely care for some more tips if you got them!\n",

Rather than sniffing each store, it could be simpler to just maintain an aggregated set.  E.g. If you had a session var of 'bananas' and a derived var of 'grapes', `model._allProps = { grapes: 'derived', bananas: 'session' }`, or equivalent.  Then scanning everything wouldn't be such a hassle.  Just throwin' out ideas :)\n\n@pgilad,\n\n> \"whether allowing overriding &state private vars for usage in state/props/derived is the right way to go\". \n\n I don't fully understand this bit. can you clarify?\n",

      "body": "Thanks for the input @Immortalin.  The presence of a package.json is a declarative manifest stating that \"this package is defined by these characteristics and dependencies.\"  To go modify the folder structure and generate a new package.json is to declare the first package.json insufficient.  99.99 percent of projects using it specify a main script used when importing the library.  Here, that's not the case.  Further, such requirements aren't stated in the README.  I would run npm install in a repo simply by observing a package.jsons presence, as that is how it is intended to be used, if dependencies are listed.\n\nMy tone is cordial, not brash, FTR :).  Anyway, we have an automated build script that npm installs all packages with a package.json then after runs all builds that have a Gruntfile/gulp file if present.  This automated workflow is what uncovered the issue\n",

I've been toying with electron-rebuild.  as you may be aware, my node version !== electron's node version, so electron-rebuild has to recompile some modules against it's version.  I see the rebuild module doing something like `npm rebuild --target=TARGET_VERSION --arch=ARCH_VERSION`.  That doesn't seem to _reliably_ product builds to my expectation.  e.g. node v0.12.7 has `process.versions.modules` == 14, while my electron's === 44.  the above command still seems to build against 14, vs 44 like I expect.\n\nDo you have any tips on how I can best use npm to recompile against a target version?  Assume that I have the target header files already downloaded.  I need to use npm vs explicit node-gyp as there may be other lifecycle hooks that must be run for a module at install.\n\nI will gladly add to the README with pertinent docs if you can assist!\n",

      "body": "hey @remko,\n\nI don't think the team has this on the roadmap, but would certainly welcome a community module.  It could be as simple as:\n\n```\n// ampersand-mega/all/spine/agg.js\nmodule.exports = { State: require('ampersand-state'), Model: ..., Router: ... }  // eg ampersand-backbone ;)\n```\n\nWere such a module to be released, the internals & API of the aggregated package would change, and consuming APIs would still need to adapt accordingly.  What you gain is the ability to flip back-and-forth between multiple &-js modules' versions quickly.  This all-and-all would be a fine thing!  IMHO, however, the problems you noted don't really get addressed by a singleton package.   The legal teams will _still_ need to sniff _nested_ licenses.  The UI tests would still need a full sweep.\n\nI humbly believe that the best we can do as a framework team is (a) keep on top of denoting clear changelogs and (b) keep on top of writing many, diligent tests.  You've noted that changelogs _aren't_ kept.  This isn't fully true, but hasn't been rigorously followed either.  This is definitely a place for improvement.  cc @AmpersandJS/core-team for making a changelog process \"more official.\"\n\nI've written and deleted various responses to this, unable to select the right wording.  However, to summarize simply, as a fellow user, I don't believe that further simplicity or clarity is achieved by aggregation.\n\nSome specific responses to some of your bullets:\n\n> My npm-shrinkwrap.json is currently 2300 lines long, ...\n\na big project is a big project.  I think having \"many dependencies\" is unfortunate in that it generates a long list, but it's the beauty of the unix philosophy.  I _personally_ wouldn't claim that \"many dependencies\" is a strong complexity adder.\n\n> ... modules combined are all over the place: some modules depend on underscore, some on lodash.*...\n\nI hope this is not the case.  the group made a big effort to lodashify almost everything.  at least the official modules\n\n> Whenever I detect I need to upgrade a module, I'm too scared to do it these days\n\nYea, better changelogs could definitely help--I'm with you here for sure.  However, that's what semver and testing are for too, which are invalueable assets in any huge project.  sounds like yours is a pretty big one!\n\n> This greatly simplifies the dependency tree in a project using ampersand ...\n\nAt a cost.  A cost of ambiguity of purpose, and refactor-ability of the consuming code.  `¯\\_(balance)_/¯`.\n\n> Keeping track of what changes in ampersand is easier ...\n\nthis is a complicated claim.  for some us, perhaps yes.  for my usual use cases (picking and choosing a small subset), I would not think so.\n\n> It makes it easier to report global ampersand issues such as this one...\n\nI'm not confident such a thing exists (\"global ampersand issues\").  I think what you are getting at is when some change or bug affects many modules?  As a counter, wouldn't it feel _incorrect_ to post the issue in a global place versus the offending package/repo?\n\nAnyway, that's my long response to a long question.  :)  I respect your opinion as a peer and active ampersander, so I hope nothing came off brash!\n",

BTW, i'm not firmly attached to my PR--i'm much more interested in coming out with the right design, so no worries if that was a concern.\n\n> We're trying to fit three options into a binary-shaped hole\n\nright.  respectfully, IMHO, the your proposed strategy still suffers the same issue.  promise api, cb api--same thing. ok ok, there are some differences, but the existence of `.promisify` or `.nodeify` are testaments to the claim :)\n\nconsider the following:\n- returning a resolved promise as a means to set form state can be dicey because of namespace conflicts. e.g. `return promiseXhr.get(url)`.  also, if the user chained on to the call, it's misleading that all was well to them.\n- using a cb strategy doesn't change the problem.  `return xhr.get(..., cb)`.  the handler will still have an empty `err` first argument.\n- returning a rejected promise doesn't work, because of the original intent of the PR--meaningful errors are swallowed\n- using a cb strategy in the error field doesn't change the problem.  `myBrokenAsyncCall(..., cb)`.  same as the rejected promise.\n\ni think the **problem lies in that we are trying to detect form error state implicitly** through a control flow which is susceptible to transmitting data of unknown types and content. \n\nif we pass in a separate method entirely to set form error state (a bound/unbound actionCreator perhaps), then all of reasoning around whether or not the operation was successfully/unsuccessful goes away--the user explicitly declares/defines it.\n\n> Validation errors: The promise is never resolved or rejected; wait for your errors to show up as props on the next process tick.\n\nthis reduces usability, and arguably introduces non-determinism.\n\ni'd like to chase something like\n\n``` js\nconst validate = (values, setErrors) => {\n  if (!values.firstName) {\n    return setErrors({\n        firstName: 'Required'\n    });\n}\n```\n\nif it's possible.\n\nwhat do you think?\n",

      "body": "> Why change the travis config to npm run lint instead of just updating the make lint target? \n\ni want to run the lint task automatically on pre-commit s.t. all contributors don't forget to lint their code manually. i could surely use the make command, but\n- it's extra overhead (i.e. runs an extra child process vs running the eslint directly), and\n- adds an extra level of indirection\n  - runs a command purely as a proxy to another command `npm => make => eslint` vs just `npm => eslint`\n  - npm scripts are already acting as a task runner--why sustain a redundant secondary task runner?\n\n> I am somewhat obsessed with GNU Make, it's one of my favorite tools\n\n`make` is great, but IMHO it's not friendly or common in the js community. if this were a `C++` library, id say rock on, but using ~~js standards~~ common js practices in a js lib seems kind of like an \"of course\" sort of thing to me.  i would lobby that make is not _as_ friendly to new contributors.\n\nit's sort of bikeshedding in the grand scheme of things. anyway, hopefully we can come to resolution\n",

Attachments ...\n\ncould be a no-op if the proxy solution was considered\n\n---\n\nto summarize again, events happen on my stores.  sync events, change events, etc.  i must cache Pouch generated emitters in my app and pass them around to those who need to listen.  a more natural feeling approach to is enable `myPouch.on(...)` like interface.  this provides simple and unified Event API for a pouch instance.\n",

I would lobby that it does so to a significant extent, too. 3rd party libs have continuing rolling updates/perf-patches/security patches.  we now own all of that.\n- rolling our own ODM induces significant business risk\n  - it was previously suggested `camo` induces big risks.  IMHO, it doesn't.  the code we write should be tested, and fear of risk is immediately negated by objective proof of our app tests meeting the specs.\n  - all of this new code is largely untested, and _there are a ton of changes here_.  i have never seen a feature this big not get merged without problems/bugs 🐛 🐞 .\n  - the ODM, even if proceeded with, _opinion*_, should be a standalone entity, vs. integrated into the erndo codebase.\n- the conversion to typescript doesn't play nicely with the standardjs mantra.  this was the agreed dev style/behavioral enforcement.  i could be i mistaken on this, but i don't think standardjs plays nicely with typescript.\n  - introducing this feature means we void our prior lint/hint/validation plan.\n- no one knows typescript yet.  is swapping languages (to some extent), something that makes sound business sense so soon before launch?\n\ni say all of this courteously, professionally, and as someone with interest in quality-of-our-code and ease-of-maintenance of our code.  **to be direct, my preference would be close this PR, unmerged**.  the PR as it stands, from my perspective:\n- adds work,\n- induces technical debt,\n- adds risk,\n- removes the previously agreed upon lint/hint/quality-plan,\n- disrupts in-work features significantly\n\nIt adds the features of type enforcement, albeit only weakly so, as it plays only nicely at our code-level, not vendor code level.\n",

I'm confident this PR is essential for prod support and post-launch growth.\n\namidst my other issues, which I don't feel were adequately addressed, this PR is scattered with many non-unified changes.  **no changes are pointedly fixing specific problems**\n\nthe title of this PR is \"Work in progress: 421 Address not updated.\"  I know for a fact that fixing that problem takes exactly two LOC to fix.\n\nthe actions taken in this PR are not rooted in engineering analysis.  what would happen if this PR were to land at Microsoft or Google?  how do you think they would react to it?\n\n> - Typescript vs StandardJS: I've been coding with a StandardJS formatter enabled the entire time I've been coding Typescript and haven't noticed a major conflict\n- excellent.  good to know. this makes me much more OK with this component.\n\n> ... technical leaders agree JavaScript doesn't scale.\n\nthis is subjective and outright false.  these reviews need to be rooted in objectivity, or be made clear otherwise.\n\n> ... bizarre mistakes that can be made easily with it. Unit testing is a great tool to cover algorithms and calculators etc, but not everyone knows how to cover code well or test cases may simply be missed.\n\nSoftware Engineering 301.  I don't know what to say further on the matter.  Professionals throughly test their code with a myriad of cases, especially those using finance.  Using the language as a scapegoat I don't see as a valid argument.  If that was a valid argument to begin with, we probably would have started with Java/C++/etc.\n\n> - In terms of learning, you can ramp up gradually. You can just code JavaScript. At first you'll notice that, all of a sudden your code editor is giving smart autocomplete suggestions and warning you about errors without you even knowing anything about it. Gradually, as you leverage typing you'll realize, others can very easily understand and use your code. \n\nCool.  I can get behind that.\n\n> - TypeScript makes it easier for newcomers to navigate our codebase. \n\nAgain, false, and opinionated.\n\n> Camo gives false sense of security to developers and this is dangerous.\n\nThis doesn't add up.  This is a statement rooted in opinion and without substance to support it.  I have objectivity showing that my consumption of the library demonstrates that it behaves exactly per expectations.\n\n> I'd rather have developers understand that they're working against a MongoDb and they need to manage how/when data is loaded, learn how all that works, rather think a magical framework is taking care of everything for them.\n\nAgain, this doesn't add up.  Angular?  Typescript?  Two major frameworks that abstract away javascript itself.  Don't get me wrong, frameworks are great, but it's not reasonable to actively stand on both sides of the fence.\n\n> - Camo is badly broken.  ... etc\n\nIt's not.  You guys had issues with it (which perhaps were valid) but weren't able to pin point them.  Respectfully, that's not on `camo`.  Scaffolding up test cases (formally or informally) isn't hard, and it should be the first reaction instead of guess-and-check or \"trash it.\"\n\n> Document.ts is more of a helper, than an ODM. ... I see it as a Data Access Layer, that makes things convenient for us. And if bugs are found, they're very transparent and easy to resolve, because Document.ts is very thin.\n\nData Access layer, ODM... call it what you want to call it--it's filling the same purpose.  See my team TL;DR  in slack.  It is a response to this already.  Respectfully, I feel like my specific points regarding the benefits of the ODM are being dismissed.\n\n> Babel doesn't work. Save for a magical week or two are the initial config babel has always been in a barely working state. Source maps not working properly, makes it very difficult to pinpoint some issues, which will limit our response time to in production bugs.\n\nIrrelevant for the discussion.\n\n> Conflicts: It's unfortunate that there'll be some conflicts. But any code I've converted so far, converted pretty quickly. Hopefully in the future we'll avoid conflicts of this magnitude.\n\nVery.  To be honest, I think it's somewhat disrespectful \"hey, I gutted the code and your stuff will break as a consequence.\"  Especially when I'm not seeing thorough or objective validation.\n\n> We take out babel, camo -- now have only single db provider\n\nWe only did have one db provider.  Native mongo + your data-access layer is the same.\n\n> we reduce some complexity.\n\nwe don't, and respectfully, you haven't addressed my points yet claiming why.  I've responded early in this PR's life to my concerns, I sent out slack discussion, and my big response above, but I still don't see a piece-meal technical decomposition of my formal arguments. all complexity suggested that has been removed is immediately introduced by still creating your own ODM and introducing a second language layer over that which we already have.  we create conflicts, we create more cases of change against already untested code.  i'm sure typescript is great.  this isn't the way to introduce it.\n\n> In theory the changes I'm making may look complicated  ... we are actually consolidating to more solid tech with a lot of support behind it.\n\nagain, respectfully, not relevant to the original concerns presented.\n\n> I'm making the decision to go forward with the merge and I'll need everyone's support to merge conflicting code, ... this PR is essential for prod support and post-launch growth.\n\nrespectfully, what I believe I'm observing is a knee jerk reaction to chase the next bright shiny thing.  the implementation is not well planned or organized.  it's a big heap of co-mingled multipurpose change which I believe I have articulated has very clear and specific weakpoints.  arguments are made counter to my arguments with big-global statements.  \"typescript is great\" and \"microsoft and google are behind it.\"  there's simply no content to reasonably fill in the `# problem statement` `#solution` PR blocks for this PR.\n\ni urge an attempt at delivering the many objectives you desire, each bundled in specific and focused changes, each with objective justification behind them.  for instance, out of this i could see:\n1. a pr fixing the embedded document refs\n2. a pr migrating any getters/setters on the existing ODM to functions\n3. a pr migrating to typescript\n4. a pr swapping the ODM\n\ni'd also hope that each of these would be rooted from specific project goals, or problem statements we manage and discuss collectively, whether that be via github or waffle.\n",

      "body": "I did not title this issue well.  The title presumes a solution instead of describing the problem.  The problem is that I need to be able to modify ajax requests.  clearly, the simple existence of the `options.ajax` field is an acknowledgement that \"sure, web devs need to be able to control their webrequests.\"  The problem is that I can only modify an ajax request _once_, on initialization.  my use case is already described above, where our authentication scheme yields a JWT that expires.  continued use of our services refresh the JWT.  hence, I want to update our headers with the new JWT s.t. my pouches continue to sync, even after expiration.\n\n@ssured's use case is a great one--we do that too.  it's actually a different problem, albeit solved through the same means.\n\nso, no, I don't need to wrap `pouchdb-ajax`, but that's how I did it before.  another solution, which may be a lot easier, is to add a request lifecycle hook [here perhaps?](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/blob/master/packages/pouchdb-ajax/src/ajaxCore.js#L88).\n\nmaybe `options.preReqeust` is a thing.  then there on L88 we can do a\n\n``` js\nif (options.preRequest) {\n  options.preRequest(options)\n}\n```\n\nand let user-land code meddle with `options`.  just an idea!\n",

We tagged all eject related commits with a🔧 emoji, and thus intended to `rebase` + `drop` them once we solved the problem!\n-  this `history` issue is most likely our problem.  thank you! it was _right there in the README_. we will patch shortly.\n- the current deployment, as you observed, is incorrect.  it is a product of my incomplete troubleshooting.  please disregard its known naughty, not-per-the-instructions state.\n  - your messages & warnings are top notch--i violated them intentionally thinking that a webpack plugin may have been at fault for not rendering my content.\n- lastly, unrelated, VisualBasic was great.  I'm glad you gave it props in that nodeup podcast a ways back.  I finally got around to listening and was happy to hear your defense of VB, as I have ~= the same story.\n\nthx again.  we will report back and close the issue out when work resumes on this project later in the week.\n",

JSON dumping content should not be considered \"too hard\" for an algo author when they are competent to do advanced mathematics and general programming.  where should the technical threshold be??  i would subjectively lobby that run-of-the-mill programming serialization techniques should be an expectation of algo authors. \n\nstdout/stderr behavior, also, IMHO, was reasonable given negative 0 time to crank out a feature. we collectively was discussed to use file i/o, which we never got around to implementing.  writing a file IMHO is often more difficult than a `print(...)` statement :).  now ur talkin' streams _and_ some serialization mechanism.\n",

It would be nice to rather detect if React.DOM had been imported/tokenized and just check if the MemberExpression === that reference, _and_ if there is yet another field `Identifier` tacked onto it.\n",

IMHO those should remain on the user pages, not the dev pages.\n\nwhilst you're upset that I asked some repeat questions, I was disgruntled with my lack of ability to do things that I felt should be entirely obvious, but couldn't because the right docs aren't in the right place.\n\nso (genuinely) **sorry for the shade**, i'm grateful for your response, but this issue shouldn't be demoralizing, IMHO, it should be expected.\n",

[select-view](https://github.com/AmpersandJS/ampersand-select-view/blob/master/ampersand-select-view.js#L276) clears it by default.  however, to counter that, clearing by default doesn't represent a _true_ reset if validation was present on init. so 👍 \n- API.  my _personal_ pref would be for the API to be more akin to `field.clear({ validate: false })`.  more specifically, an object based argument, to ++communication/readability.  it's definitely not the status quo (shame on me!) but if this will be rippling back up to form and possibly into other fields, it may be a good opportunity to make it great 💪 \n",

Example: 1.0.0-alpha < 1.0.0-alpha.1 < 1.0.0-alpha.beta < 1.0.0-beta < 1.0.0-beta.2 < 1.0.0-beta.11 < 1.0.0-rc.1 < 1.0.0.\r\n\r\ntherefore, `e280254d` is > `c82c4f05`, which makes some amount of sense.  the hash is still treated like a version number, so long as everything preceding is a match.",

I'm not sure if there are any significant advantages to isolating those props, only to shim them right back into the root node.

Passing on the unhandled props gives a great user experience, IMHO, and adds ~nil complexity.

      "body": "I respect these points, but disagree with them for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n> You may have more than one HTML element that you want to modify.\r\n\r\nIf that is necessary, than that other element should also be exposed.  SUIR, for example, often hangs related elements off of a root element for this reason. in [this  example](https://react.semantic-ui.com/collections/form), you can see they have things like `<Form.Button />` & `<Form.XYZ />` to use instead of the defaults, if you want to override internal components with other props/goodies.\r\n\r\nIt's also worth noting that SUIR use a similar pattern to that which I've proposed, but do so via a babel plugin [ref1](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI-React/blob/c8fabc7805ad23eeeaed9ec37c128ca4d508a3aa/package.json#L92) [ref2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-transform-react-handled-props).\r\n\r\nThis plugin based approach is a more advanced solution, which is probably also worth considering.  In the PR'd case, this component is a functional stateless component, so the benefits of the plugin approach are less, but still valid--especially if we have `Component`/`PureComponent`s in RSGs component tree!\r\n\r\n> You won't accidentally leak undesired props to DOM (resting all props is dangerous).\r\n\r\nI respectfully don't think that this carries much weight.  If one has leaked a prop, he/she has done it upstream, and the bug still exists.\r\n\r\n> The API is much more clear.\r\n\r\nThe API IMHO is much less clear because it's an entirely new API to find and use.  By making it a separate API, you can't just add props to your node, like you would naturally with any other HTML tag.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks for having this discussion.  I'm not trying to be stubborn/ill-willed/etc, just advocating.  I'd still be happy to use `containerProps` over _nothing_.",

      "body": "# Generic Settings Loader\n## Background\n\nI have two features in development, separate from this PR, that involve accessing OctoPrint settings.  I feel that the settings protocol is a little clunky in current state, and disliked that the settings must be explicitly and redundantly called out in the code.  This PR serves to make getting/setting of settings simpler exclusively for the developer.  I foolishly branched from foosel/master instead of foosel/devel, so I'd like to request to do the PR now, then after issues are settled, perform the conflict resolution.  This is a **large** PR, so I would be happy to annotate it heavily to help the review process OR schedule time to review together online.\n## Changed Setting Loading Behavior\n### Server Side\n1. Made the get/set methods **generic** in the Settings class and the Settings API.  I.e., just call `get()` vs. `getInt/getBool/etc`.  Uses new function `coercePrimative()` to infer native type when passed js stringified IO.  Additionally this permits us to reduce the number of times all of the settings are explicity laid out in each file (from 4x => 2x [1x for server 1x for client].  Perhaps a package build process can reduce this need further as Python Dictionary and js Object syntax are ~equivalent.\n2. Server ajax set/get \"all\" functions now use a generic setting **iterator**, vs. explicity calling out each setting.\n3. To facilitate the above, the default settings are intially broken into two dictionaries. 1) settings usable and exposed to the client, then 2) another dictionary that is not exposed to the client.  They are zipped back into a single default_settings variable on init.  The ajax getters/setters determine which properties to send by looking at the client dictionary.\n### Client Side\n1. Similair to server, I have listed settings for client only once in settings.js, then **auto-generate ko observables** (commonly listed as `koos`).\n   _This means you must only add your new setting to settings.py and settings.js a single time per file, and your new setting is accessible on server and client!_\n### Helpers\n\n`eachDeep()` and `dict_merge()` were introduced in collectionUtils.py as a means to recurse through the settings and to zip dictionaries together, respectively.\n## Updated folder setting loading scheme\n\nBecause folder get/set functions are reliant on getBaseFolder/setBaseFolder (file IO), the the batch get/set of the ajax requests couldn't be handled without special cases.\nTo permit using the generic functions and still update the folders properly:\n1. Auto create the default folders on load via setUserDirs()\n2. After the ajax set is executed, run setUserDirs() again to build the new dir immediately.\n\n```\nNote--the *pre-existing* upload feature has a bug wherein if you change the upload dir, you must restart the server for the change to take place.  I will have a follow up PR to resolve this.\n```\n## General\n1. Linted js -- fixed syntax errors (missing ;'s, == vs. ===, etc)\n2. Alphabetized all settings dictionaries (server) & objects (client) for consistency\n3. Alphabetized some file's member functions for readability (settings.js)\n4. **Unified setting names between client and server**\n",

      "body": "This PR fixes https://github.com/AmpersandJS/ampersand-select-view/issues/5.  The module and tests appeared to be designed intentionally to not fail when setting a bogus value.  I.e., if the available options are `['a', 'b', 'c']` and you call `setValue('d')`, the select would just revert to the 0th index option or unselectedText.  This behavior is dangerous.  Issue 5 and self experience would indicate the there is a bug in the application code, thus, we now trigger errors when this situation occurs.\n\nThis PR additionally:\n1. Enforces that the returned value is _always a string_.  Only if `unselectedText` option is selected could `undefined` possibly be appropriate.  Would like feedback on this.  `.value` on empty `<select>`s is generally the empty string, DOM-wise.\n2. Denotes a plan for 4.x release\n3. adds more tests for numeric cases\n4. small tidy ups\n",

It addresses a variety of other opens as well.\n\nPer the new README.md changelog:\n## changelog\n1. Improve general option edge cases, and add supporting test cases.  Primarily targets falsy option value handling.\n2. Validate immediately to assist when parent FormView tests onload for field validity.  Update `skipValidation` to `skipValidationMessage`, permit immediate validation, but conditionally display messages.\n3. Throw an `Error` when trying to `setValue(value)` and an option _matching the requested `value`_ does not exist.  The exception to this is when the provided value is `null`, `undefined`, or `''`, and a `null` option value exists.  Because the DOM can only recognize a single empty value for any `<option>`, which is the empty string `''`, only a single empty-ish option can only be supported by the view.\n4. Support `0` value options, both in Model id's and array values.\n5. Add `eagerValidate`.\n6. Denote a plan for 4.x release\n7. bulk update README, and some cody tidying\n",

The intent of the PR is not to cover all cases... just this little guy!  However, we could instead listen for the specific `not found` error:\n\n``` bash\ncdieringer@Snapper-osx:~/node/pouchdb$ node\n> require('abcd')\nError: Cannot find module 'abcd'\n```\n# test discussion\n\nit's a tricky one to write tests for, as it requires different prebuilt leveldown versions.  not sure if folks think it's a worthwhile thing to test.  regardless, i installed pouch with node 0.12.7, ran the tests (pass), switched to iojs 2.5.0, ran the tests, and confirmed that the helpful error was present:\n\n<img width=\"544\" alt=\"1_tests_pass\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1003261/10409498/fc3195aa-6ed7-11e5-8ba1-496c0c112d9f.png\">\n<img width=\"534\" alt=\"2_switch_to_iojs\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1003261/10409499/fc33d356-6ed7-11e5-8a00-b6f3a9d7e9b0.png\">\n<img width=\"683\" alt=\"3_observe_new_error\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1003261/10409500/fc344bb0-6ed7-11e5-888e-3968f236981d.png\">\n",

See [here](http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/api/error-management-configuration.html#global-rejection-events) for ref.\n- error handlers are not commonized between `uncaughtException` and `unhandledRejection`\n- some log activity is silenced because logger is not registered early enough\n- redundant logging activity occurs per long design discussion in #44 \n- #56\n# solution\n- primarily, address #44.  the other issues simply get bundled in as consequence\n- close #56\n- tidy index.js.  you will see a lot of RED. open it in just raw mode.  enjoy it's simplicity! :)\n# discussion\n- note the new content that shows up when you run the api.  that should have been present the whole time!\n- note how we never error, log, then throw again.  this is **antipattern**.  throw, log, and crash.  OR, throw, recover, optionally log, continue\n  - if you are _not_ going to recover, don't `try` wrap or `.catch` wrap.  no recovery means non-deterministic state, and the global error handlers which log and kill should kick in.\n",

Please use https://github.com/yarnpkg/rfcs -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain the **motivation** for making this change. What existing problem does the pull request solve? -->\r\n\r\nIn my described use case, it is logical to use the _very same parser_ rather than an independent parser.  There's no value in duplicate tooling, and integrity/quality of the operation can suffer if using an alternative.  Some may challenge that exposing such functionality is out of scope for this project.  However, I would argue that exposing internals is a big enabler and comes with a very low cost + cost-of-ownership.\r\n\r\n# solution\r\n\r\n- incrementally expose some internal APIs so `yarn` can be used programmatically.  `YARN_AS_LIB` tells the entry point to expose the library by default, vs executing the CLI.\r\n\r\n**Test plan**\r\n\r\n- an integration test could be done to call into the library from a shell, although im not seeing such test code in `__tests__` ATM, and i figured core maintainers would have a preference on how to execute such a test.\r\n\r\n# review\r\n\r\n**review with `?w=1` in the URL such that github more cleanly displays the very few changes.  https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/pull/3397/files?w=1**\r\n\r\n![yarn-as-lib mov](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1003261/26028300/7a7053ec-37d2-11e7-81c7-ba70561c39bc.gif)\r\n\r\n",
